# Erdos Problem #81 - Three-Paper Public Release

This repository records the public release package for Juan Pablo Traverso Gianini's announced resolution of Erdos Problem #81 on clique partitions of chordal graphs.

## Main Result

The announced asymptotic theorem is

```text
max{cp(G): G chordal, |V(G)| = n} = (1/6 + o(1)) n^2.
```

The constant `1/6` is sharp.

## Current Public Release

The current release is organized in:

```text
public_release/
```

It contains the final three-paper public package:

```text
public_release/
  00_SERIES_DOCUMENTS/
  PAPER_I/
  PAPER_II/
  PAPER_III/
  THREE_PAPER_SERIES_ANNOUNCEMENT.md
  THREE_PAPER_SERIES_ANNOUNCEMENT_FINAL.tex
  THREE_PAPER_SERIES_ANNOUNCEMENT_FINAL.pdf
```

Each paper folder contains:

- manuscript sources and PDF;
- public audit records;
- reproducibility scripts and outputs;
- integrity artifacts.

The public-only integrity manifest is:

```text
public_release/00_PUBLIC_INTEGRITY/
```

This integrity folder was generated only from the public release files. It intentionally does not include the private internal working record.

## Sealed Complete Package

The complete author package, including internal working records, is archived only in encrypted form:

```text
sealed/THREE_PAPER_SERIES_COMPLETE_PACKAGE.zip.enc
sealed/THREE_PAPER_SERIES_COMPLETE_PACKAGE.zip.enc.sha256
```

The plaintext complete package and encryption key are not stored in this repository.

## Historical Materials

Earlier announcement files, sealed archives, and draft folders may remain in this repository for timestamp/history purposes. The current public release should be read from `public_release/`.

## Lean Formalisation

A Lean 4 / Mathlib formalisation of the Paper A split-graph component is included in:

```text
paper_A_split_graphs_preprint_v02/
```

This contribution was prepared by Jamal Agbanwa, with Aristotle, and contains the Lean project files under `RequestProject/`.
