## Paper IV — v1.23 editorial revision

**Clique partitions with rooted simplicial defect: quantitative stability and
sharp eventual bounds.** Version 1.23 moves administrative history out of the
manuscript and adds a bilingual explainer. Mathematical content and the Lean
freeze are unchanged from the published v1.22, whose consolidated external
review is **PASS, E0–E8, zero open corrective actions**. The v1.23 documentary
checks are separate. This release is authorized for GitHub publication;
a new Zenodo version deposit remains separate.

The paper proves the all-orders chordal bound c₄(G) ≤ floor(n(n+1)/6) + b
for an absolute constant, and the sharp eventual maximum. It also treats
rooted simplicial defect, quantitative same-root stability of graphs and
partitions, and explicit (impractical) thresholds. See the manuscript for exact
hypotheses and attribution. Neither universal b = 0 nor priority for the
extremal bound is claimed.

## Papers I–III

| Paper | Current preprint | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [I](preprints/PAPER_I/README.md) | v1.3 — Affine Profile Reduction for Fractional Triangle Packings in Split Graphs | Finite fractional triangle-packing bound for split graphs |
| [II](preprints/PAPER_II/README.md) | v1.2 — Complete-Split Extremizers for a Fractional Triangle-Cover Functional on Chordal Graphs | Exact fractional-cover extremum on chordal graphs |
| [III](preprints/PAPER_III/README.md) | v1.5 — Linear-Error Clique Partitions of Split Graphs via Structured Triangle Packing | Integral split-graph bound with sharp quadratic coefficient 1/6 |

Their released packages and historical audits are unchanged. Each paper has
its own English and Spanish manuscripts, source freeze and verification
evidence. Earlier verdicts do not substitute for Paper IV's audit.

## Formal verification and limits

Paper IV uses source identity `piv-v12-fb459343d234`: 607 Lean modules and
615 source/configuration entries. The verified external build checked 607
modules, 19 targets and 224 publication exports, plus a separate 50-module
annex. Later editorial reviews inherited that evidence by checked identity;
they did not rerun the kernel. Audited axiom footprints use only propext,
Classical.choice and Quot.sound, or subsets.

Lean, Mathlib and their pinned dependencies remain third-party software.
These preprints are not human peer-reviewed. The external AI report discloses
the same model family, continuation of its audit session and shared
machine/cache. The mandatory supplemental log verifier remains part of
reproduction. No claim of bibliographic originality follows from a cone check.

## Citation, integrity and licenses

Use [CITATION.md](CITATION.md), [CITATION.bib](CITATION.bib) or
[CITATION.cff](CITATION.cff). The series concept DOI remains
[10.5281/zenodo.21273143](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21273143).
The existing [Papers I–III deposit](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22064657)
does not include Paper IV. The published v1.22 is tagged `paper-IV-v1.22`,
commit `cfcd5cf57cadc8583a218caaa1476911efe6158a`.
The author has supplied [10.5281/zenodo.23089131](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.23089131)
for the new version including Paper IV. Its public deposit was not yet
available when checked on 1 October 2026; registration/publication remains
a separate Zenodo step. The concept DOI above is unchanged.

The root `manifest_sha256.txt` covers the prepared repository except itself
and Git metadata. Paper IV has its own manifest and verification procedure.
Earlier Paper IV manuscripts required by the audit, including published
v1.22, are retained as audit backups rather than alternative current editions;
the public v0.8 draft is preserved as superseded.

Documents follow CC BY-NC 4.0; see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md). Existing upstream
software licenses remain applicable; packaging does not relicense Mathlib
or separately licensed Lean Pool/Mathlib contributions.
The original Paper III `Ax2` Lean sources are also available under Apache-2.0
through the author's [specific source-code grant](LEAN_SOURCE_APACHE_2_0_GRANT.md);
this exception does not change the license of the papers or audit artifacts.
