# Nibble — the **line design**: block sub-triples shared between several cluster triples

`Nibble.AX1.gridShift` (`Nibble.GridShiftUnique`) and `Nibble.AX1.gridUW_bijective`
(`Nibble.GridShiftBalance`) organise the sub-triples *inside one cluster triple*: the diagonal
labelling `(j, k) ↦ (j + k)` uses every block pair of every one of the three cluster pairs exactly
once, so one cluster triple alone already tiles its three pairs.

The assembly of `Nibble.AX1.BlockCoverResidual` (`Nibble.CoreGapBlockCover`) needs the *partial*
version of that statement, because a cluster pair `(U, W)` is in general shared by many cluster
triples `(U, W, X)`, and the rectangles used by different triples through the same pair have to be
disjoint.  The right unit of allocation is then not a single block pair but a whole **diagonal**:
writing the blocks of each cluster as `ZMod q`, the *line*

`L (a, b) = { (j, j + a, j + b) : j ∈ ZMod q }`

is a family of `q` block sub-triples whose three projections are the diagonal `a` of the pair
`(U, W)`, the diagonal `b` of `(U, X)` and the diagonal `b - a` of `(W, X)`.  The `q` diagonals
partition the `q²` block pairs of a cluster pair (`Nibble.AX1.diagIndex_bijective`), so allocating
*diagonals* to the triples through a pair is exactly the deterministic load-balancing problem that
`Nibble.AX1.balanced_bucket_le` (`Nibble.LoadBalance`) addresses, one dimension down.

* `Nibble.AX1.lineTriple` — the block sub-triple `(j, j + a, j + b)`;
* `Nibble.AX1.diagIndex_bijective` — the `q` diagonals of a cluster pair partition its `q²` block
  pairs (the partial-allocation form of `Nibble.AX1.gridUW_bijective`);
* `Nibble.AX1.lineTriple_UW_unique`, `Nibble.AX1.lineTriple_UX_unique`,
  `Nibble.AX1.lineTriple_WX_unique` — a family of lines whose labels `a`, `b` and `b - a` are
  pairwise distinct uses every block pair of every one of the three cluster pairs at most once;
* `Nibble.AX1.lineTriple_pair_disjoint` — two cluster triples through the same cluster pair that are
  given **disjoint** sets of diagonals never use a common block pair.

Everything here is at the level of block *indices*; no probability and no graph theory.

Must be sorry-free and axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
