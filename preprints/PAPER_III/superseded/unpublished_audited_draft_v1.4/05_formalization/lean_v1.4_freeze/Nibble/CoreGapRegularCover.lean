# Nibble — the *covering* criterion for a near-regular family, and the cluster structure

`Nibble.AX1.HasNearRegularFamily G ε μ η d₀` (`Nibble.CoreGapRegularFamily`) mentions the fractional
optimum `ν₃*(G)`.  This file supplies the tool that discharges that bookkeeping for a construction:
it is enough to *cover* the edges of `G` that lie in a triangle, all but `ε|V|²` of them, by an
edge-disjoint family of near-regular subgraphs.

* `Nibble.AX1.triangleSupport` — the subgraph of the edges lying in at least one triangle.  It has
  the same triangles as `G`, hence the same fractional optimum
  (`Nibble.AX1.nu3star_triangleSupport`).
* `Nibble.AX1.unionFamily` — the union of a family; for an edge-disjoint family its edge count is
  the sum of the members' edge counts (`Nibble.AX1.card_cliqueFinset_two_unionFamily`).
* `Nibble.AX1.hasNearRegularFamily_of_cover` — **the covering criterion**: `ν₃*` of the union of the
  family is at most a third of its edge count (`Nibble.YusterE.nu3star_le`), and the uncovered edges
  cost at most their number (`Nibble.AX1.nu3star_le_add_deleted`).  So a near-regular family
  covering all but `ε|V|²` of the triangle-carrying edges is a near-regular family in the sense of
  `Nibble.AX1.HasNearRegularFamily`, with **no reference to `ν₃*` in the hypotheses**.  Note that
  this criterion is only *sufficient*: see the discussion at the end of the file for why demanding
  such a covering of the whole triangle support is in general too strong, so that the residual
  itself must keep `ν₃*`.
* `Nibble.AX1.GoodTriple`, `Nibble.AX1.regularityReduced_triangle_parts`,
  `Nibble.AX1.triangleSupport_regularityReduced_goodTriple` — the cluster structure the residual has
  to exploit: every triangle of a regularity-reduced graph has its three vertices in three distinct
  parts, pairwise uniform and dense, and every edge of its triangle support joins two clusters of
  such a good triple.

/-! ### The covering criterion -/

/-- **The covering criterion.**  An edge-disjoint family of near-regular subgraphs of the triangle
support of `G`, covering all but at most `ε|V|²` of the edges of that support, is a near-regular
family for `G` in the sense of `Nibble.AX1.HasNearRegularFamily`.

Indeed the fractional optimum of `G` is that of its triangle support
(`Nibble.AX1.nu3star_triangleSupport`); passing from the support to the union of the family costs at
most the number of uncovered edges (`Nibble.AX1.nu3star_le_add_deleted`); and the fractional optimum
of the union is at most a third of its edge count (`Nibble.YusterE.nu3star_le`), which for an
edge-disjoint family is a third of the sum of the members' edge counts. -/

/-! ### Why the covering criterion is not the residual

`Nibble.AX1.hasNearRegularFamily_of_cover` is a *sufficient* condition, and it is strictly stronger
than what is needed: requiring that *all but `ε|V|²`* of the triangle-carrying edges be covered by
near-regular classes is in general impossible.  Near-regularity forces a class inside a cluster
triple to carry roughly equally many edges in each of the triple's three pairs (the triangles of the
class are counted once from each pair), so a triple whose three pairs have very different densities
— say `1`, `1/10`, `1/10` — can have only about `3/10` of its edges covered, the rest of the dense
pair remaining uncovered even though each of its edges lies in a triangle.  For such a graph the
fractional optimum is correspondingly small, which is exactly why `Nibble.AX1.HasNearRegularFamily`
(and hence the residual `Nibble.AX1.ReducedFamilyResidual`) compares the covered edge count with
`ν₃*` rather than with the total number of edges.

The covering criterion remains useful as a *tool*: applied to a subgraph `G' ≤ G` together with
`Nibble.AX1.HasNearRegularFamily.mono_of_le`, it discharges the `ν₃*` bookkeeping whenever the
construction does cover the chosen subgraph. -/
