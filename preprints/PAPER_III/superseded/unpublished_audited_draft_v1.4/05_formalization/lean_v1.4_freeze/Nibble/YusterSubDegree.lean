# Yuster (edge-based) — cardinality and degree-sum of `triangleHypergraphSub`

Standalone, Mathlib-only. Foundation of the edge-based near-regularity (②a). The edge-vertex-type
triangle hypergraph `triangleHypergraphSub G` has exactly `|cliqueFinset 3|` = `#triangles` hyperedges
(the powerset-subtype map is injective on 3-cliques), and — being `3`-uniform — its degree sum over the
edge vertices is `3·#triangles` (handshake). This pins the AVERAGE edge triangle-degree at
`3·#triangles / |E(G)|`, the anchor for "most edges are near-regular".

* `triangleHypergraphSub_card` — `|triangleHypergraphSub G| = |cliqueFinset 3 G|`.
* `sum_degree_triangleHypergraphSub` — `∑_E deg_E = 3·|cliqueFinset 3 G|`.

Must be sorry-free and axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
