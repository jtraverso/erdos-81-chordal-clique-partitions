# Nibble — Module C1 : one nibble round (deterministic scaffolding)

Standalone, Mathlib-only. Foundation for the Rödl-nibble project.

A *nibble round* takes a set `R` of "retained" edges (in the probabilistic argument `R` is a
random subset of `H`, but every structural fact here is deterministic and holds for *any* `R`):

* `roundMatching R` — the retained edges that are isolated, i.e. disjoint from every other
  retained edge. These form a genuine matching.
* `covered R` — the vertices used by that matching.
* `residual H R` — the edges of `H` that avoid the covered vertices; the hypergraph the next
  round works on.

Results:
* `roundMatching_isMatching` — `roundMatching R` is a matching of the ambient `H` (when `R ⊆ H`).
* `residual_subset`, `residual_uniform` — the residual hypergraph is a sub-hypergraph of `H`
  and stays `r`-uniform.
* `residual_disjoint_covered` — every residual edge avoids the covered set (well-formedness of
  the iteration invariant).

The probabilistic content (expected sizes, concentration) is Layer C2/C3 and consumes Layer B.
Definitions (`degree`, `IsUniform`, `IsMatching`, `support`) come from `Nibble.Basic` /
`Nibble.Greedy`. Must be sorry-free and axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
