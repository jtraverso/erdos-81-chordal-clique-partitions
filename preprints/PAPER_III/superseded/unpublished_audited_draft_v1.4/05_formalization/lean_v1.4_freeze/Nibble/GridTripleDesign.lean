# Nibble — the **global (multi-triple) block design**

`Nibble.AX1.gridShift` (`Nibble.GridShiftUnique`) and `Nibble.AX1.gridUW_bijective`
(`Nibble.GridShiftBalance`) organise the block sub-triples *inside one cluster triple*, and
`Nibble.AX1.lineTriple` (`Nibble.GridLineDesign`) isolates the unit of allocation, a whole
**diagonal** of a cluster pair.  What `Nibble.AX1.BlockCoverResidual`
(`Nibble.CoreGapBlockCover`) is missing beyond that is a *simultaneously consistent* choice of
diagonals: a cluster pair `{a, b}` is shared by many cluster triples `{a, b, x}`, and the diagonal
that a triple uses in the pair `{a, b}` is not free — it is determined by the shifts the triple
gives to its three clusters, which have to work for all three of its pairs at once.

This file solves that allocation problem outright, deterministically and in closed form.

## The design

Index the clusters by distinct elements of a prime field `ZMod q` and the blocks of every cluster
by `ZMod q` as well.  To the cluster triple with **vertex sum** `s = u + w + x` associate the
*quadratic shift*

`triShift s v = v ^ 2 - v * s`

and let its `j`-th block sub-triple (`j ∈ ZMod q`) use, in cluster `v`, the block

`triBlock s v j = j + triShift s v`.

For a fixed triple, `j ↦ triBlock s v j` is a bijection of the blocks of `v`
(`Nibble.AX1.triBlock_bijective`): each cluster is covered exactly once, so the `q` sub-triples of
a triple tile the three cluster pairs along one diagonal each, as in the line design.

The point of the quadratic shift is the identity

`triShift s b - triShift s a = (b - a) * (a + b - s)`  (`Nibble.AX1.triShift_diff`),

so in the pair `{a, b}` the triple occupies the diagonal of offset `(b - a) * (a + b - s)`, which,
for `a ≠ b`, is an *injective* function of `s`.  Consequently two distinct cluster triples through
the same cluster pair always sit on different diagonals of that pair, and therefore never share a
block pair — for **all three** of their pairs at once, because the vertex sum `s` is symmetric in
the triple (`Nibble.AX1.triPairSet_disjoint`, `Nibble.AX1.triPairSet_disjoint_of_third`).

## Contents

* `Nibble.AX1.triShift`, `Nibble.AX1.triBlock` — the design;
* `Nibble.AX1.triShift_diff` — the diagonal offset of the pair `{a, b}` in the triple of sum `s`;
* `Nibble.AX1.triBlock_bijective` — each cluster is covered exactly once by the `q` sub-triples;
* `Nibble.AX1.triBlock_eq_lineTriple` — the sub-triples of a fixed triple form a line, so the
  single-triple statements of `Nibble.GridLineDesign` and `Nibble.GridShiftBalance` apply verbatim;
* `Nibble.AX1.triPairSet` and `Nibble.AX1.card_triPairSet` — the `q` block pairs a triple uses in
  one of its pairs;
* `Nibble.AX1.triPairSet_disjoint`, `Nibble.AX1.triPairSet_disjoint_of_third` — the disjointness
  across triples;
* `Nibble.AX1.card_triPairSet_biUnion` — hence `q * (number of triples through the pair)` distinct
  block pairs are used in a cluster pair, out of the `q ^ 2` available: the allocation is feasible
  as soon as `q` is at least the number of clusters.

Everything here is at the level of block *indices*: no probability, no graph theory, and no
choice of an ordering of the clusters.
