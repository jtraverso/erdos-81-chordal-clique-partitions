# Nibble — step-2 invariant : the residual keeps max degree `≤ Δ`

Standalone, Mathlib-only. The "free" half of the step-2 round invariant: since every nibble residual
is a sub-hypergraph of `H` (`nibbleResidual_subset`), degrees only drop, so a global max-degree bound
`Δ` on `H` is inherited by every residual. (`r`-uniformity is likewise inherited, via
`nibbleResidual_uniform`.) These are the hypotheses of `exists_good_retention'` that hold for free
each round; the LOWER near-regularity (which does degrade) is the substantive part.

Must be sorry-free and axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
