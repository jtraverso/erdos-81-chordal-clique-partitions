# Nibble — the **coupled** block-allocation residual

`Nibble.AX1.BlockCoverResidualFine` (`Nibble.CoreGapBlockCover`) asks for the block family at
*every* regularity scale `ε₁` and *every* relative block size `α ≤ δ/2` at once.  That is more than
the reduction to AX1 ever uses, and more than a nibble construction can deliver: a weighted nibble
in the hypergraph of grid cells only produces a near-perfect matching when the grid is *large*, i.e.
when the number of clusters `≈ 1/ε₁` and the number of blocks per cluster `≈ δ/α` are both large in
terms of the accuracy `ε`.

This file states the residual in the coupled form the construction can actually meet, and redoes
the reduction to AX1 with the coupling threaded through:

* `Nibble.AX1.BlockCoverResidualCoupled` — for every accuracy `ε`, density threshold `δ ≤ ε`, block
  uniformity scale `ε₂` and scale floor `T₀`, there is a regularity window `ε₁ ≤ ε₁₀(ε, δ, ε₂, T₀)`
  inside which the residual chooses its own relative block size `α` (only asked to satisfy
  `ε₁/8 ≤ α`, `2α ≤ 1` and `(ε₁/8)/α ≤ ε₂`, the three inequalities the design needs) and then
  produces the family of block sub-triples.
* `Nibble.AX1.subTripleDesignLocalResidual_of_blockCoverCoupled`,
  `Nibble.AX1.ax1_of_blockCoverCoupled` — the reduction.  It is the reduction of
  `Nibble.AX1.subTripleDesignLocalResidual_of_blockCoverFine` with the two parameters the residual
  now fixes — the regularity scale `ε₁` and the relative block size `α` — read off from the
  residual instead of being chosen in advance; the only inequalities used about them are the ones
  the coupled residual guarantees.

/-! ### The arithmetic of the construction

The block scale `τ` is large (`8 ≤ τ·δ`), the blocks have size between `¾τδ` and `⁵⁄₄τ`, and the
regularity scale `ε₁` is small compared with `δ`, `μ₂` and `η`.  The four lemmas below are the only
computations the reduction needs; they are stated in isolation to keep the context small. -/

/-- **The coupled block-allocation residual.**  Given the accuracy `ε`, a density threshold
`δ ≤ ε`, the block uniformity scale `ε₂` that the caller needs and a scale floor `T₀`, the residual
names a regularity window `ε₁₀ > 0`; for every regularity scale `ε₁ ≤ ε₁₀` it then names a relative
block size `α` with `ε₁/8 ≤ α`, `2α ≤ 1` and `(ε₁/8)/α ≤ ε₂` — the three inequalities the transfer
of regularity from the clusters to the blocks needs — and, for all large enough
`(ε₁/8)`-regular equipartitions, a family of block sub-triples at that `α` with pairwise disjoint
vertex-pair rectangles carrying the fractional optimum up to `ε|V|²`.

Compared with `Nibble.AX1.BlockCoverResidualFine` the two scales `ε₁` and `α` are no longer
universally quantified independently: the residual may demand that the regularity scale be fine
(hence the number of clusters large) and may pick the relative block size itself (hence the number
of blocks per cluster large).  Both are exactly what the reduction to AX1 leaves free, which is why
`Nibble.AX1.ax1_of_blockCoverCoupled` still goes through. -/
