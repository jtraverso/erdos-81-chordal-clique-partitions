## Abstract

Let \(G=(K\cup I,E)\) be a split graph on \(n\) vertices, with \(K\) a clique and \(I\) an independent set. We prove that there is an absolute constant \(C\) such that

\[
|E(G)|-2\nu_3(G)
\le
\frac{n^2}{6}+Cn,
\]

where \(\nu_3(G)\) is the maximum number of pairwise edge-disjoint triangles in \(G\). Consequently,

\[
\operatorname{cp}(G)
\le
\frac{n^2}{6}+Cn
\]

for every split graph \(G\), where \(\operatorname{cp}(G)\) is the minimum number of cliques whose edge sets partition \(E(G)\). This strengthens the asymptotic \((1/6+o(1))n^2\) bound to the correct linear-error scale. The leading constant is sharp.

The proof separates three regimes according to \(\alpha=|I|/|K|\). In the bulk regime, an exact four-orbit linear program for a common-neighborhood profile yields a uniform quadratic fractional margin; the Haxell--Rödl theorem then absorbs the subquadratic integrality loss. When \(\alpha\to0\), large edge-disjoint matchings anchored at the independent vertices leave an almost complete, triangle-divisible clique residual, which is decomposed exactly by dense graph decomposition results. When \(\alpha\to2\), averaged factorization closes the short corridor, while a double-factor polarization inequality and a shifted-center gain-completion argument close the remaining mesoscopic corridor.

The proof does not establish the stronger universal estimate \(\nu_3^*(G)-\nu_3(G)=O(n)\). Away from the extremal corridor, a potentially superlinear integrality gap is absorbed by quadratic fractional slack.

All corridor mechanisms are self-contained; in particular, the list edge coloring ingredient is proved from first principles in Appendix D. Only two external asymptotic theorems remain, confined to the bulk and sparse regimes, and the near-extremal corridor theorem (Proposition 10.1) is fully elementary and effective.

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Clique partitions of split graphs

A **clique partition** of a graph \(G\) is a family of complete subgraphs whose edge sets partition \(E(G)\). Cliques of order two are allowed. The minimum size of such a family is denoted by \(\operatorname{cp}(G)\).

The chordal clique-partition problem of Erdős, Ordman, and Zalcstein asks for the correct extremal order of \(\operatorname{cp}(G)\) on chordal graphs. Their complete-split (indeed threshold) construction shows that the coefficient \(1/6\) is unavoidable. Split graphs form a natural and important subclass of chordal graphs: a graph is split if its vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set.

This is the third paper in the series on the Erdős–Ordman–Zalcstein clique-partition problem (Erdős Problem #81). Paper I proves a finite fractional split-graph bound, \(|E(G)|-2\nu_3^*(G)\le n^2/6+n\). Paper II identifies the complete-split terminal family and determines the exact finite maximum of the fractional cover functional over chordal graphs. Papers I and II are fractional and are formally verified in Lean 4. The present paper is the first integral installment: it strengthens the split-graph estimate to the linear-error scale \(n^2/6+O(n)\).

Paper II of the series determines the fractional extremal problem exactly. For every \(n\),

\[
\max_{\substack{|V(G)|=n\\G\text{ chordal}}}
\bigl(|E(G)|-2\nu_3^*(G)\bigr)
=
\max_{\substack{|V(G)|=n\\G\text{ split}}}
\bigl(|E(G)|-2\nu_3^*(G)\bigr)
=
\left\lfloor\frac{(2n+1)^2}{24}\right\rfloor.
\]

It follows, by standard fractional-to-integral rounding, that every chordal graph satisfies

\[
\operatorname{cp}(G)
\le
\left(\frac16+o(1)\right)n^2.
\]

The present paper addresses a different and genuinely second-order question: it strengthens the integral bound to \(n^2/6+O(n)\) for arbitrary split graphs.

## 1.2 Triangle packings and the linear-error target

Let \(\nu_3(G)\) be the maximum number of pairwise edge-disjoint triangles in \(G\). Every such packing gives a clique partition: keep every packed triangle and use one \(K_2\) for each uncovered edge. Hence

\[
\operatorname{cp}(G)
\le
|E(G)|-2\nu_3(G).
\tag{1.1}
\]

The central theorem of this paper is an integral estimate at the correct second-order scale.

### Theorem 1.1 — Linear-error split-graph theorem

There exists an absolute constant \(C\) such that every split graph \(G\) on \(n\) vertices satisfies

\[
\boxed{
|E(G)|-2\nu_3(G)
\le
\frac{n^2}{6}+Cn.
}
\tag{1.2}
\]

Combining (1.1) and Theorem 1.1 gives the clique-partition statement.

### Corollary 1.2 — Linear-error clique partition bound

There exists an absolute constant \(C\) such that every split graph \(G\) on \(n\) vertices satisfies

\[
\boxed{
\operatorname{cp}(G)
\le
\frac{n^2}{6}+Cn.
}
\tag{1.3}
\]

The Erdős--Ordman--Zalcstein complete-split (indeed threshold) family \(K_p\vee\overline K_{2p}\), with \(n=3p\), shows that the leading constant \(1/6\) is sharp and that a linear term naturally appears.

![The complete-split extremizer \(K_p\vee\overline K_{2p}\). The drawing is schematic: the left side represents the clique \(K_p\), the right side represents an independent set of order \(2p\), and every cross edge is present. One triangle is highlighted to show that every triangle contains a clique edge.](paperIII_figures_bilingual_v0.9.7/fig1_complete_split_extremizer_en.png)

**Figure 1.** The complete-split graph \(K_p\vee\overline K_{2p}\). Every edge between the two parts is present, and the independent side has no internal edges. Since every triangle contains a clique edge, an edge-disjoint triangle packing uses at most \(\binom p2\) triangles; see Section 10.2. The figure is illustrative and is not used as a premise of the proof.

## 1.3 Localization of hypothetical obstructions

### Proposition 1.3 — Localization of hypothetical obstructions

Suppose, for contradiction, that no absolute linear-error bound holds, and for each positive integer \(k\) choose a minimum-order split graph \(G_k\) satisfying

\[
|E(G_k)|-2\nu_3(G_k)>\frac{|V(G_k)|^2}{6}+k|V(G_k)|.
\]

After passing to a subsequence, writing \(|K_k|=p_k\), \(|I_k|=q_k\), every such hypothetical sequence must satisfy

\[
\frac{q_k}{p_k}\longrightarrow 2.
\]

Moreover, if \(q_k=2p_k-s_k\), then the bulk and short-corridor estimates force

\[
\sqrt{p_k}\ll s_k=o(p_k).
\]

Thus any obstruction to a linear error term would have to concentrate in the mesoscopic near-extremal corridor. The high/low-dispersion dichotomy in Section 9 excludes that corridor.

## 1.4 What the theorem does not prove

Let \(\nu_3^*(G)\) denote the fractional triangle-packing number. The present proof does **not** establish

\[
\nu_3^*(G)-\nu_3(G)=O(n)
\tag{1.4}
\]

uniformly over split graphs.

Indeed, write

\[
\Delta(G)=\nu_3^*(G)-\nu_3(G)
\]

and

\[
S(G)=\frac{n^2}{6}-\bigl(|E(G)|-2\nu_3^*(G)\bigr).
\]

Then

\[
|E(G)|-2\nu_3(G)
=
\frac{n^2}{6}-S(G)+2\Delta(G).
\tag{1.5}
\]

Theorem 1.1 only requires

\[
2\Delta(G)\le S(G)+O(n).
\]

In the bulk regime, \(S(G)\) is quadratic and absorbs the general \(o(n^2)\) integrality loss. Thus the universal linear integrality-gap problem remains open.

## 1.5 Proof architecture

Write

\[
|K|=p,
\qquad
|I|=q,
\qquad
\alpha=\frac qp.
\]

The ratio \(\alpha=q/p\) determines which source of slack is available. We first dispose of \(q\ge2p-1\) by direct averaged factorization, and may then assume \(0\le\alpha<2\). A hypothetical sequence of counterexamples has a subsequence in one of three regimes.

1. **Bulk:** \(\alpha\) stays away from both \(0\) and \(2\). An exact common-profile LP and a fractional cloning argument produce quadratic fractional slack. Haxell--Rödl converts the fractional packing into an integral one with only \(o(n^2)\) loss.

2. **Sparse independent side:** \(\alpha\to0\). Each independent vertex anchors a large matching inside its neighborhood. The residual clique is almost complete. After deleting \(O(p)\) edges to correct divisibility, it admits an exact triangle decomposition.

3. **Near-extremal corridor:** \(\alpha\to2\). Write \(q=2p-s\). Averaged factorization closes \(s=O(\sqrt p)\). For \(\sqrt p\ll s=o(p)\), high dispersion is paid by a double-factor polarization term, while low dispersion implies closeness to a common center and is handled by shifted-center gain completion.

The division is not cosmetic. In the bulk there is enough quadratic fractional slack to absorb a general \(o(n^2)\) rounding loss. At the two ends that slack vanishes, so the proof replaces generic rounding by constructions adapted to the geometry of the split presentation.

![A schematic map of the three proof regimes on the parameter axis \(\alpha=q/p\): the sparse regime near \(0\), the bulk away from both endpoints, and the near-extremal corridor near \(2\).](paperIII_figures_bilingual_v0.9.7/fig2_alpha_regimes_en.png)

**Figure 2.** The three parameter regimes used in the proof. The principal corridor thresholds are shown; the complete hypotheses are stated in Sections 4, 8, and 9. The endpoint regimes are asymptotic rather than hard subintervals of \([0,2]\).

## 1.6 Supplementary computational audits

The accompanying closure package contains exact-arithmetic and finite-instance regression tests for selected identities and quantitative inequalities used in the proof.

Every audited statement is proved analytically in the manuscript. No computation, script, finite enumeration, or solver output is a logical premise of Theorem 1.1. The supplementary material is provided solely for independent checking, regression testing, and reproducibility.

## 1.7 Organization

Section 2 fixes notation and external inputs. Section 3 solves the common-profile LP. Section 4 proves the fractional cloning bound and the global fractional margin. Section 5 develops averaged and double-factor rounding. Section 6 proves polarization. Section 7 proves shifted-center gain completion. Section 8 handles the sparse-independent regime. Section 9 assembles the three regimes. Section 10 records corollaries, Section 11 discusses the proof and its limitations, and Section 12 describes future uses and open directions. The appendices contain algebraic details, the divisibility correction, reproducibility material, and a self-contained proof of the list edge coloring theorem (Appendix D).

# 2. Preliminaries

## 2.1 Split notation

Throughout,

\[
G=(K\sqcup I,E)
\]

is a split graph, where \(K\) is a clique of size \(p\) and \(I=\{v_1,\ldots,v_q\}\) is independent.

For \(v_i\in I\), write

\[
N_i=N(v_i)\cap K,
\qquad
d_i=|N_i|,
\qquad
S_i=K\setminus N_i,
\qquad
m_i=|S_i|.
\]

Set

\[
M=\sum_i m_i,
\qquad
S_2=\sum_i m_i^2.
\]

When \(q\) is close to \(2p\), write

\[
q=2p-s.
\tag{2.1}
\]

## 2.2 Triangle packings

A fractional triangle packing is a nonnegative weight assignment to the triangles of \(G\) such that the total weight through every edge is at most one. Its maximum value is \(\nu_3^*(G)\).

The dual is a fractional triangle cover: a nonnegative weight assignment to edges such that every triangle receives total edge weight at least one. LP duality gives equality between the two optimum values.

## 2.3 Complete graph factorizations

Adopt the boundary conventions

\[
\chi'(K_0)=\chi'(K_1)=0.
\]

For \(t\ge2\), the edge-chromatic number of a complete graph is

\[
\chi'(K_t)
=
\begin{cases}
t-1,&t\text{ even},\\
t,&t\text{ odd}.
\end{cases}
\tag{2.2}
\]

Thus \(E(K_t)\) decomposes into \(\chi'(K_t)\) matchings. The conventions for \(t\le1\) make the same language valid for empty edge sets.

## 2.4 External theorems

We use two external asymptotic inputs. (Earlier versions cited a third, the list edge coloring theorem; the case required by this paper is proved self-contained in Appendix D, so Sections 5--7 and Proposition 10.1 depend on no external theorem.)

### Theorem 2.1 — Haxell--Rödl/Yuster

For every fixed graph \(H\),

\[
\nu_H^*(G)-\nu_H(G)=o(|V(G)|^2)
\]

uniformly over graphs \(G\). We apply this with \(H=K_3\).

### Theorem 2.2 — List edge coloring (proved in Appendix D)

Let \(B\) be a bipartite graph with maximum degree \(\Delta(B)\). If every edge \(e\) is assigned a list \(L(e)\) with

\[
|L(e)|\ge\Delta(B),
\]

then \(B\) has a proper edge coloring choosing the color of each edge from its list.

This is the maximum-degree case of Galvin's theorem [12]. A self-contained proof (König coloring, stable pairings, and the kernel lemma) is given in Appendix D, so this is not an external dependency of the paper. The local refinement \(|L(xy)|\ge\max\{d(x),d(y)\}\) of Borodin, Kostochka, and Woodall [2] is not needed: hypothesis (7.2) already bounds every list by the maximum degree of the gain graph.

### Theorem 2.3 — Dense triangle decomposition

For every \(\varepsilon>0\), every sufficiently large triangle-divisible graph \(H\) with

\[
\delta(H)\ge(0.9+\varepsilon)|V(H)|
\]

admits a triangle decomposition. This follows from Dross's fractional triangle decomposition theorem (minimum degree \(0.9v\) suffices fractionally) combined with the iterative-absorption theorem of Barber, Kühn, Lo, and Osthus, which converts the fractional threshold into an exact decomposition threshold for triangle-divisible graphs, up to \(\varepsilon\) and for sufficiently large order.

# 3. The Common-Profile Linear Program

For integers \(p,q,d\), let \(H(p,q,d)\) be the split graph with clique \(K\), \(|K|=p\), independent set \(I\), \(|I|=q\), and a fixed set \(N\subseteq K\), \(|N|=d\), such that every vertex of \(I\) has neighborhood \(N\). Put \(R=K\setminus N\) and \(r=p-d\).

## 3.1 Symmetric cover variables

Averaging over permutations of \(N\), \(R\), and \(I\), an optimal fractional triangle cover may be assumed constant on the four edge classes

\[
E(N),
\qquad E(N,I),
\qquad E(N,R),
\qquad E(R).
\]

Let their weights be \(a,b,c,e\), respectively. The triangle constraints are

\[
a+2b\ge1,
\qquad
3a\ge1,
\tag{3.1}
\]

\[
a+2c\ge1,
\qquad
2c+e\ge1,
\qquad
3e\ge1.
\tag{3.2}
\]

Constraints corresponding to empty triangle types may be omitted; the formula below remains valid for \(p\ge3\).

The objective is

\[
\binom d2a+qdb+dr\,c+\binom r2e.
\tag{3.3}
\]

## 3.2 Exact solution

### Theorem 3.1 — Common-profile formula

For \(p\ge3\),

\[
\boxed{
\nu_3^*(H(p,q,d))
=
F(p,q,d),
}
\tag{3.4}
\]

where

\[
\boxed{
F(p,q,d)
=
\min\left\{
\frac{\binom p2+qd}{3},
\binom d2+\binom r2,
\binom d2+\frac{dr+\binom r2}{3}
\right\}.
}
\tag{3.5}
\]

### Proof

At an optimum,

\[
b=\frac{1-a}{2},
\qquad
c=\frac{1-\min\{a,e\}}2,
\qquad
\frac13\le a,e\le1.
\]

If \(a\le e\), decreasing \(e\) to \(a\) cannot increase the objective. It therefore suffices to minimize on

\[
\frac13\le e\le a\le1.
\]

The objective is affine on this triangle, so a minimum occurs at

\[
(a,e)=\left(\frac13,\frac13\right),
\qquad
(1,1),
\qquad
\left(1,\frac13\right).
\]

The corresponding values are precisely the three expressions in (3.5). Duality completes the proof. \(\square\)

## 3.3 Interpretation of the three covers

The minimum in (3.5) is easier to remember through the three vertices of the reduced two-variable program. Each vertex represents a distinct way to pay for the triangle constraints.

| Cover pattern | Reduced vertex \((a,e)\) | Value | Geometric description |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **Uniform** | \((1/3,1/3)\) | \(\bigl(\binom p2+qd\bigr)/3\) | All relevant edge orbits are covered at the uniform fractional rate. |
| **Separated** | \((1,1)\) | \(\binom d2+\binom r2\) | The two clique blocks \(N\) and \(R\) are paid internally, with no weight on the crossing orbit. |
| **Hot neighborhood** | \((1,1/3)\) | \(\binom d2+\bigl(dr+\binom r2\bigr)/3\) | The common neighborhood \(N\) is paid in full, while the residual clique structure remains fractional. |

The labels are descriptive rather than additional definitions. In later calculations we refer to the corresponding first, second, and third branches of \(F\). This finite trichotomy is the source of the global fractional margin.

# 4. Fractional Cloning and the Exact Fractional Margin

## 4.1 Fractional cloning

The cloning operation here is the cover-side analogue of the clone symmetrization used in Paper II. There, vertices or clone classes are copied pairwise to simplify a chordal graph. Here, one independent-set profile is copied \(q\) times in a single averaging step; the graph \(H(p,q,d_i)\) records the resulting common profile.

### Lemma 4.1 — Fractional cloning bound

For every split graph with \(q\ge1\),

\[
\boxed{
\nu_3^*(G)
\ge
\frac1q\sum_{i=1}^qF(p,q,d_i).
}
\tag{4.1}
\]

### Proof

Let \(y\) be any fractional triangle cover of \(G\). Put

\[
A=\sum_{e\in E(K)}y_e
\]

and

\[
B_i=\sum_{x\in N_i}y_{v_ix}.
\]

Replace \(v_i\) by \(q\) independent clones, all with neighborhood \(N_i\), and give each clone the incident weights of \(v_i\). Together with the original clique-edge weights, this is a fractional cover of \(H(p,q,d_i)\) of weight \(A+qB_i\). Hence

\[
A+qB_i\ge F(p,q,d_i).
\]

Summing over \(i\) gives

\[
q\left(A+\sum_iB_i\right)
\ge
\sum_iF(p,q,d_i).
\]

Minimizing over covers proves the lemma. \(\square\)

## 4.2 The exact margin

Assume \(0<q\le2p\), set

\[
\alpha=\frac qp,
\]

and define the packing threshold

\[
T(G)=\frac12\left(|E(G)|-\frac{(p+q)^2}{6}\right).
\tag{4.2}
\]

Define

\[
\mu(\alpha)
=
\begin{cases}
\alpha^2/12,&0\le\alpha\le2/3,\\
(2-\alpha)^2/48,&2/3\le\alpha\le2.
\end{cases}
\tag{4.3}
\]

### Theorem 4.2 — Unified fractional margin

\[
\boxed{
\nu_3^*(G)
\ge
T(G)+\mu(\alpha)p^2-\frac p4.
}
\tag{4.4}
\]

### Proof

Let

\[
C_\alpha=\frac{2-2\alpha-\alpha^2}{12}.
\]

For each branch of \(F(p,q,d)\), completion of squares gives

\[
F(p,q,d)
\ge
\frac{qd}{2}+C_\alpha p^2+\mu(\alpha)p^2-\frac p2.
\tag{4.5}
\]

The three normalized residual minima are

\[
\frac{\alpha^2}{12},
\qquad
\frac{(2-\alpha)^2}{48},
\]

and

\[
\begin{cases}
\alpha(8-5\alpha)/48,&\alpha\le4/3,\\
(2-\alpha)^2/12,&\alpha\ge4/3.
\end{cases}
\]

The third is never below the minimum of the first two. Averaging (4.5) through Lemma 4.1 gives

\[
\nu_3^*(G)
\ge
\frac12\sum_i d_i+C_\alpha p^2+\mu(\alpha)p^2-\frac p2.
\]

Since

\[
T(G)=\frac12\sum_i d_i+C_\alpha p^2-\frac p4,
\]

we obtain (4.4). \(\square\)

## 4.3 Bulk consequence

If

\[
\varepsilon\le\alpha\le2-\varepsilon,
\]

then \(\mu(\alpha)\ge c_\varepsilon>0\). Theorem 4.2 and Haxell--Rödl imply

\[
\nu_3(G)\ge T(G)
\]

for all sufficiently large graphs in this regime. Hence

\[
|E(G)|-2\nu_3(G)
\le
\frac{n^2}{6}.
\tag{4.6}
\]

---

# 5. Factorization Rounding Near \(q=2p\)

Let

\[
r_p=\chi'(K_p).
\]

## 5.1 One-factor averaging

### Lemma 5.1

If \(q\ge r_p\), then

\[
\boxed{
\nu_3(G)
\ge
\frac1q\sum_i\binom{d_i}{2}.
}
\tag{5.1}
\]

### Proof

Factor \(K_p\) into \(r_p\) matchings. Assign the factors injectively and uniformly to vertices of \(I\). In the factor assigned to \(v_i\), retain only edges with both endpoints in \(N_i\). The retained edges form valid edge-disjoint \(KKI\) triangles.

The expected number retained is

\[
\frac1q\sum_i\sum_{j=1}^{r_p}|F_j\cap E(K[N_i])|
=
\frac1q\sum_i\binom{d_i}{2}.
\]

Some assignment attains at least the expectation. \(\square\)

Writing \(q=2p-s\), substitution gives

\[
\Phi(G)
\le
\frac{n^2}{6}+\frac p2-\frac{s^2}{6}
+
\frac{(s-1)M-S_2}{q}.
\tag{5.2}
\]

Using \(S_2\ge M^2/q\) and maximizing the resulting parabola yields

\[
\boxed{
\Phi(G)
\le
\frac{n^2}{6}+\frac p2+\frac{s^2-6s+3}{12}.
}
\tag{5.3}
\]

Thus \(s=O(\sqrt p)\) is closed with linear error.

## 5.2 Double-factor rounding

For a clique edge \(e=xy\), let

\[
b_e=|\{i:\{x,y\}\not\subseteq N_i\}|.
\]

Put

\[
h=\min\{r_p,q-r_p\},
\qquad
\delta=\frac h{r_p}.
\]

Choose the set of \(h\) factors that receive two distinct independent vertices uniformly at random, give one independent vertex to every other factor, and assign the independent vertices to the resulting positions uniformly and injectively. All expectations below are taken over both random choices; some deterministic choice attains at least the expected gain.

### Lemma 5.2 — Double-factor inequality

If \(q\ge r_p\), then

\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\Phi(G)
\le{}&
\frac{n^2}{6}+\frac p2-\frac{s^2}{6}
+
\frac{(s-1)M-S_2}{q}\\
&-
\frac{2\delta V}{q(q-1)},
\end{aligned}
}
\tag{5.4}
\]

where

\[
V=\sum_{e\in E(K)}b_e(q-b_e).
\tag{5.5}
\]

### Proof

If the factor containing \(e\) receives one vertex, \(e\) is lost with probability \(b_e/q\). If it receives two vertices, it is lost only when both are bad, with probability

\[
\frac{b_e(b_e-1)}{q(q-1)}.
\]

Thus the expected number \(U\) of lost clique edges is

\[
U
=
\frac1q\sum_e b_e
-
\frac{\delta}{q(q-1)}\sum_e b_e(q-b_e).
\]

Because every factor is a matching, each retained edge may be assigned to one of its admitting vertices without creating an edge collision. Substitution gives (5.4). \(\square\)

---

# 6. Quantitative Polarization

For every \(i\), define

\[
\mathcal B_i=\{e\in E(K):e\cap S_i\ne\varnothing\}.
\]

Then

\[
V=\sum_{i,j}|\mathcal B_i\setminus\mathcal B_j|.
\tag{6.1}
\]

Let

\[
m=\max_i|S_i|.
\]

### Lemma 6.1 — Polarization inequality

If \(2p-3m-1\ge0\), then

\[
\boxed{
V
\ge
\frac{2p-3m-1}{4}
\sum_{i,j}|S_i\triangle S_j|.
}
\tag{6.2}
\]

### Proof

Put

\[
a_{ij}=|S_i\setminus S_j|.
\]

The edges in \(\mathcal B_i\setminus\mathcal B_j\) are precisely the edges of \(K_p-S_j\) meeting \(S_i\setminus S_j\). Therefore

\[
|\mathcal B_i\setminus\mathcal B_j|
=
\frac{a_{ij}\bigl(2(p-|S_j|)-a_{ij}-1\bigr)}2.
\]

Since \(|S_j|\le m\) and \(a_{ij}\le m\),

\[
|\mathcal B_i\setminus\mathcal B_j|
\ge
\frac{2p-3m-1}{2}|S_i\setminus S_j|.
\]

Sum over ordered pairs and use

\[
\sum_{i,j}|S_i\setminus S_j|
=
\frac12\sum_{i,j}|S_i\triangle S_j|.
\]

This proves (6.2). \(\square\)

---

# 7. Shifted-Center Gain Completion

Fix \(R\subseteq K\). Put

\[
\rho=|R|,
\qquad
Q=K\setminus R,
\qquad
b=|Q|.
\]

For each \(i\), define

\[
T_i=S_i\setminus R,
\qquad
t_i=|T_i|,
\]

and

\[
G_i=R\setminus S_i,
\qquad
g_i=|G_i|.
\]

Set

\[
A_R=\sum_i t_i,
\qquad
A_{2,R}=\sum_i t_i^2,
\qquad
B_R=\sum_i g_i.
\]

Let

\[
r_b=\chi'(K_b),
\qquad
u=q-r_b.
\]

Assume

\[
b\ge2,
\qquad
q\ge r_b,
\qquad
b\ge\chi'(K_\rho),
\tag{7.1}
\]

and

\[
b-t_i\ge\max\{\rho,u\}
\qquad
\text{for all }i.
\tag{7.2}
\]

Define

\[
\theta_R=\frac{\max\{\rho-1,0\}}{b}
\]

and

\[
\kappa_R
=
1-2(1-\theta_R)\frac{u}{q}.
\tag{7.3}
\]

## 7.1 Packing inside \(Q\)

Reserve a set \(U\subseteq I\) of \(u\) vertices; note that \(|I\setminus U|=q-u=r_b\) exactly. Assign the remaining \(r_b\) vertices bijectively to a factorization of \(K[Q]\).

For \(v_i\), the number of unavailable edges of \(K[Q]\) is

\[
\beta_i
=
\binom b2-\binom{b-t_i}{2}.
\tag{7.4}
\]

For fixed \(U\), averaging over assignments gives at least

\[
\binom b2-\frac1{r_b}\sum_{i\notin U}\beta_i
\tag{7.5}
\]

edge-disjoint \(QQI\) triangles.

## 7.2 The gain graph

Construct a bipartite graph with parts \(U\) and \(R\), joining \(v_i\) to \(r\) when \(r\in G_i\). Assign the list

\[
L(v_ir)=N_i\cap Q.
\]

By (7.2), every list satisfies

\[
|L(v_ir)|=b-t_i
\ge
\max\{\rho,u\}
\ge
\Delta,
\]

where \(\Delta\) is the maximum degree of the gain graph, since \(d(v_i)=g_i\le\rho\) and \(d(r)\le|U|=u\). Theorem 2.2, proved self-contained in Appendix D, gives a proper list edge coloring. If \(v_ir\) receives color \(z\in Q\), take the triangle \(v_irz\). This gives

\[
B_U=\sum_{i\in U}g_i
\]

edge-disjoint \(IRQ\) triangles.

## 7.3 Completion inside \(R\)

For each \(z\in Q\), let \(U_z\subseteq R\) be the vertices \(r\) for which \(rz\) was used by an \(IRQ\) triangle.

If \(\rho\le1\), the graph \(K[R]\) has no edges, so this completion contributes no \(RRQ\) triangles. Suppose therefore that \(\rho\ge2\). Factor \(K[R]\), inject its factors into the colors \(z\in Q\), and delete from the factor assigned to \(z\) every edge incident with \(U_z\). Averaging over the injections loses at most

\[
\frac{\rho-1}{b}\sum_z|U_z|
=
\theta_RB_U
\]

edges. Hence, in all cases, we obtain at least

\[
\binom\rho2-\theta_RB_U
\]

additional \(RRQ\) triangles.

The three families \(QQI\), \(IRQ\), and \(RRQ\) are edge-disjoint. In particular, the forbidden-color deletion prevents an \(IRQ\) triangle and an \(RRQ\) triangle from sharing an edge \(rz\).

## 7.4 The centered inequality

Choose \(U\), \(|U|=u\), maximizing

\[
\sum_{i\in U}
\left(
\frac{2\beta_i}{r_b}+2(1-\theta_R)g_i
\right).
\]

The best \(u\) terms have sum at least \(u/q\) times the total. Using

\[
2\sum_i\beta_i
=(2b-1)A_R-A_{2,R},
\]

we obtain the principal local lemma.

### Lemma 7.1 — Reserved-gain shifted-center inequality

Under (7.1)--(7.2),

\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\Phi(G)
\le{}&
\frac{n^2}{6}+\frac p2-\frac{s^2}{6}
+s\rho-2\rho^2\\
&+
\kappa_RB_R
+
\frac{(s-2\rho-1)A_R-A_{2,R}}q.
\end{aligned}
}
\tag{7.6}
\]

---

# 8. The Sparse-Independent Regime

Assume \(q=o(p)\). We prove the required bound directly and integrally.

## 8.1 Minimal-counterexample degree bound

In the global contradiction argument, a minimal counterexample with penalty \(kn\) satisfies, for every \(v\in I\),

\[
d(v)>
\frac{2n-1}{6}+k.
\tag{8.1}
\]

Since \(q=o(p)\), this implies eventually

\[
d(v)\ge2q+2.
\tag{8.2}
\]

## 8.2 Successive matchings

Order \(I=\{v_1,\ldots,v_q\}\). Choose successively edge-disjoint matchings

\[
M_i\subseteq K[N_i]
\]

of size \(\lfloor d_i/2\rfloor\).

Before choosing \(M_i\), each vertex has lost at most \(i-1\) incident edges, so the available graph on \(N_i\) has minimum degree at least

\[
d_i-i\ge d_i/2.
\]

Dirac's theorem supplies a Hamilton cycle and hence a matching of the required size.

Let

\[
F=\bigcup_iM_i.
\]

Then

\[
|F|
\ge
\frac12\sum_i d_i-\frac q2,
\qquad
\Delta(F)\le q.
\tag{8.3}
\]

The edges of \(M_i\) yield \(|M_i|\) edge-disjoint \(KKI\) triangles with apex \(v_i\).

## 8.3 Divisibility correction

The residual clique graph

\[
R_0=K_p-F
\]

satisfies

\[
\delta(R_0)
\ge
p-1-q
=(1-o(1))p.
\tag{8.4}
\]

In particular, for all sufficiently large members of the sequence, \(\delta(R_0)>p/2\). Dirac's theorem therefore gives a Hamilton cycle, and hence a Hamilton path

\[
P=x_1x_2\cdots x_p
\]

contained in \(R_0\). Let \(O\) be the set of odd-degree vertices of \(R_0\). By the handshaking lemma, \(|O|\) is even. Define the path subgraph \(J\subseteq P\) by

\[
x_jx_{j+1}\in E(J)
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
|O\cap\{x_1,\ldots,x_j\}|\text{ is odd}.
\tag{8.5}
\]

For an internal vertex \(x_j\), the parity of its degree in \(J\) is the change in prefix parity between positions \(j-1\) and \(j\), and is therefore \(1\) precisely when \(x_j\in O\). The same conclusion holds at the two endpoints because \(|O|\) is even. Consequently,

\[
\operatorname{Odd}(J)=O,
\qquad
|E(J)|\le p-1,
\qquad
\Delta(J)\le2.
\tag{8.6}
\]

Thus

\[
R_1:=R_0-J
\]

has all degrees even, and

\[
\delta(R_1)\ge p-1-q-2.
\tag{8.7}
\]

Since \(q=o(p)\), eventually \(\delta(R_1)>3p/4\). By Turán's theorem, \(R_1\) contains a copy of \(K_5\). Choose a \(C_4\) and a \(C_5\) inside this fixed \(K_5\). According as

\[
|E(R_1)|\equiv0,1,2\pmod3,
\]

remove respectively nothing, the \(C_4\), or the \(C_5\). Let \(C\) denote the removed cycle, allowing \(C=\varnothing\), and put

\[
H:=R_1-E(C).
\]

Every vertex loses either zero or two incident edges when a cycle is removed, so all degrees of \(H\) remain even. Moreover, \(|E(C)|\equiv |E(R_1)|\pmod3\), and hence

\[
|E(H)|\equiv0\pmod3.
\]

Therefore \(H\) is triangle-divisible. The total loss of degree in passing from \(R_0\) to \(H\) is at most four, so

\[
\delta(H)\ge p-1-q-4.
\tag{8.8}
\]

To apply Theorem 2.3 with a fixed parameter, take for example \(\varepsilon_0=1/100\). Since \(q=o(p)\), eventually \(q\le p/20\), and then, for sufficiently large \(p\),

\[
\delta(H)\ge p-1-q-4\ge0.91p=(0.9+\varepsilon_0)|V(H)|.
\tag{8.9}
\]

Theorem 2.3 now gives an exact triangle decomposition of \(H\). Notice that the decomposition theorem is applied on the original \(p\)-vertex set: no vertices are deleted during the correction. The entire correction removes at most \(p+4\) edges.

## 8.4 Packing size

The combined packing has size

\[
\begin{aligned}
\nu_3(G)
&\ge
|F|+\frac{\binom p2-|F|-O(p)}3\\
&=
\frac13\binom p2+\frac23|F|-O(p)\\
&\ge
\frac13\binom p2+\frac13\sum_i d_i-O(p+q).
\end{aligned}
\tag{8.10}
\]

Consequently,

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Phi(G)
&\le
\frac13\binom p2+\frac13\sum_i d_i+O(p+q)\\
&\le
\frac13\binom p2+\frac{pq}{3}+O(p+q)\\
&=
\frac{(p+q)^2}{6}-\frac{p+q^2}{6}+O(p+q).
\end{aligned}
\tag{8.11}
\]

This is at most \(n^2/6+O(n)\).

---

# 9. Proof of the Main Theorem

We now prove Theorem 1.1 by contradiction.

Suppose no absolute constant works. For every positive integer \(k\), choose a split graph \(G_k\), minimal in its number \(n_k\) of vertices, such that

\[
\Phi(G_k)
>
\frac{n_k^2}{6}+kn_k.
\tag{9.1}
\]

Necessarily \(n_k\to\infty\). For every \(v\in I(G_k)\), minimality gives

\[
\Phi(G_k)
\le
\Phi(G_k-v)+d(v),
\]

and therefore

\[
\boxed{
d(v)>
\frac{2n_k-1}{6}+k.
}
\tag{9.2}
\]

First, if \(q_k\ge2p_k-1\), Lemma 5.1 gives

\[
\Phi(G_k)
\le
\frac{n_k^2}{6}+\frac{p_k}{2},
\]

contradicting (9.1) for large \(k\). We may therefore assume \(q_k<2p_k-1\) and pass to a subsequence according to

\[
\alpha_k=\frac{q_k}{p_k}\in[0,2).
\]

## 9.1 Bulk regime

Suppose that for some \(\varepsilon>0\),

\[
\varepsilon\le\alpha_k\le2-\varepsilon.
\]

Theorem 4.2 gives

\[
\nu_3^*(G_k)
\ge
T(G_k)+c_\varepsilon p_k^2-O(p_k).
\]

Haxell--Rödl gives

\[
\nu_3(G_k)
\ge
\nu_3^*(G_k)-o(n_k^2).
\]

For sufficiently large \(k\), the quadratic margin dominates the integrality loss, so \(\nu_3(G_k)\ge T(G_k)\), contrary to (9.1).

## 9.2 The endpoint \(\alpha_k\to0\)

This is closed by Section 8, which gives an absolute \(C_0\) such that

\[
\Phi(G_k)
\le
\frac{n_k^2}{6}+C_0n_k.
\]

For \(k>C_0\), this contradicts (9.1).

## 9.3 The endpoint \(\alpha_k\to2\)

Write

\[
q=2p-s,
\qquad
s=o(p).
\]

If \(s=O(\sqrt p)\), inequality (5.3) gives the required linear-error bound. Assume henceforth

\[
\sqrt p\ll s=o(p).
\tag{9.3}
\]

For all sufficiently large members of the sequence,

\[
p\ge2304,
\qquad
6\sqrt p\le s\le\frac p8,
\qquad
k\ge1.
\tag{9.4}
\]

By (9.2),

\[
m_i=|S_i|
<
\frac s3+\frac16-k
\le
\frac s3-\frac56.
\]

Since every \(m_i\) is an integer, with \(m=\max_i m_i\),

\[
\boxed{3m\le s-3.}
\tag{9.5}
\]

For \(x\in K\), put

\[
a_x=|\{i:x\in S_i\}|
\]

and

\[
D=\sum_{x\in K}a_x(q-a_x).
\tag{9.6}
\]

Then

\[
\sum_{i,j}|S_i\triangle S_j|=2D.
\tag{9.7}
\]

### High dispersion

Suppose

\[
D\ge\frac{qs^2}{12}.
\tag{9.8}
\]

By (9.5),

\[
2p-3m-1\ge2p-s+2=q+2.
\]

Lemma 6.1 and (9.7) therefore give

\[
V
\ge
\frac{q+2}{2}D
\ge
\frac q2D.
\tag{9.9}
\]

The double-factor coefficient in Lemma 5.2 satisfies

\[
\boxed{\delta\ge\frac78.}
\tag{9.10}
\]

Indeed, if \(p\) is odd then \(r_p=p\) and

\[
\delta=\frac{p-s}{p}\ge\frac78,
\]

while if \(p\) is even then \(r_p=p-1\) and

\[
\delta=\frac{p+1-s}{p-1}\ge\frac78.
\]

Moreover, \(S_2\ge M^2/q\), and (9.5) implies \(M/q\le m\le(s-3)/3\). Since the resulting parabola is increasing on this interval,

\[
\frac{(s-1)M-S_2}{q}
\le
\frac{2s(s-3)}9.
\tag{9.11}
\]

Substituting (9.8)--(9.11) into Lemma 5.2 yields

\[
\Phi(G)-\frac{n^2}{6}
\le
\frac p2-\frac{5s^2}{288}-\frac{2s}{3}.
\tag{9.12}
\]

Since \(s^2\ge36p\),

\[
\Phi(G)-\frac{n^2}{6}
\le
-\frac p8-\frac{2s}{3}<0,
\]

a contradiction.

### Low dispersion

Suppose

\[
D<\frac{qs^2}{12}.
\tag{9.13}
\]

By (9.7), some \(j\) satisfies

\[
\sum_i|S_i\triangle S_j|
<
\frac{s^2}{6}.
\tag{9.14}
\]

Set

\[
R=S_j,
\qquad
\rho=|R|.
\]

Then

\[
A_R+B_R<\frac{s^2}{6},
\qquad
\rho\le m\le\frac{s-3}{3}.
\tag{9.15}
\]

We verify the hypotheses of Lemma 7.1 explicitly. Since \(s\le p/8\),

\[
q=2p-s\ge\frac{15p}{8},
\qquad
b=p-\rho\ge p-\frac s3.
\]

Thus \(b\ge2\), \(q\ge r_b\), and \(b\ge\chi'(K_\rho)\). Also \(r_b\ge b-1\), so

\[
u=q-r_b\le p-s+\rho+1.
\]

For every \(i\),

\[
2\rho+t_i+1
\le
3m+1
\le
s-2.
\]

Consequently,

\[
b-t_i\ge\max\{\rho,u\},
\]

and Lemma 7.1 applies.

If \(\rho=0\), then \(B_R=0\). If \(\rho\ge1\), then

\[
\theta_R
\le
\frac{\rho}{p-\rho}
\le
\frac{8s}{23p}.
\]

Using \(u=q-r_b\), \(r_b\le b\), and \(q\ge15p/8\), we obtain

\[
\kappa_R
=1-2(1-\theta_R)\frac uq
\le
\frac sq+2\theta_R
\le
\frac{5s}{4p}.
\tag{9.16}
\]

Likewise,

\[
\frac{(s-2\rho-1)_+}{q}
\le
\frac{5s}{4p}.
\tag{9.17}
\]

By (9.15), the total positive deviation in (7.6) is therefore at most

\[
\frac{5s}{4p}(A_R+B_R)
<
\frac{5s^3}{24p}
\le
\frac{5s^2}{192}.
\tag{9.18}
\]

Meanwhile,

\[
\frac{s^2}{6}-s\rho+2\rho^2
=
2\left(\rho-\frac s4\right)^2+\frac{s^2}{24}
\ge
\frac{s^2}{24}.
\tag{9.19}
\]

Lemma 7.1 now gives

\[
\Phi(G)-\frac{n^2}{6}
\le
\frac p2-\frac{s^2}{64}.
\tag{9.20}
\]

Since \(s^2\ge36p\), the right-hand side is at most \(-p/16\), again a contradiction.

All possible subsequences are impossible. Theorem 1.1 follows. \(\square\)

---

# 10. Corollaries

## 10.1 Clique partitions

Corollary 1.2 follows immediately from

\[
\operatorname{cp}(G)
\le
|E(G)|-2\nu_3(G).
\]

## 10.2 Sharpness of the leading term

The family

\[
K_p\vee\overline K_{2p}
\]

has \(n=3p\). A factorization of \(K_p\) assigned to independent vertices packs every clique edge into a \(KKI\) triangle. The resulting triangle-packing expression is

\[
|E|-2\nu_3
=
\frac{n^2}{6}+\frac n6.
\tag{10.1}
\]

The Erdős--Ordman--Zalcstein clique-partition construction on this family shows that the coefficient \(1/6\) cannot be improved.

## 10.3 Localization of difficult sequences

Proposition 1.3 records the localization statement supplied by the proof. It should be understood as a structural description of a hypothetical failure of every linear-error estimate, rather than as an additional extremal theorem after Theorem 1.1. The bulk margin excludes ratios bounded away from \(0\) and \(2\), the sparse construction excludes \(|I|/|K|\to0\), and averaged factorization excludes the short corridor near \(|I|=2|K|\). The only remaining location is the mesoscopic corridor

\[
|I|=2|K|-s,
\qquad
\sqrt{|K|}\ll s=o(|K|),
\]

which is then eliminated by the dispersion dichotomy.

## 10.4 Exact common-profile fractional value

Theorem 3.1 is independently useful: it gives the exact fractional triangle packing for every split graph in which all independent vertices have one common neighborhood, including the regime with too few independent vertices to color all neighborhood edges integrally. We state it as a stand-alone corollary.

### Corollary 10.4 — Exact common-neighborhood triangle packing

For all integers \(p\ge3\), \(q\ge0\) and \(0\le d\le p\), the graph \(H(p,q,d)\)
(clique of order \(p\); \(q\) independent vertices, each with the same neighborhood of size
\(d\)) satisfies
\[
\nu_3^*(H(p,q,d))=F(p,q,d)=\min\left\{\tfrac{\binom p2+qd}{3},\ \binom d2+\binom{p-d}2,\ \binom d2+\tfrac{d(p-d)+\binom{p-d}2}{3}\right\}.
\]
This is an exact closed form for the fractional triangle-packing number of an entire
one-parameter family, valid for every \(d\) including the small-\(q\) regime where no
integral factorization covers the neighborhood; it may be of independent interest outside the
clique-partition problem.

### Corollary 10.4b — Threshold graphs

Since \(K_p\vee\overline K_{2p}\) is a threshold graph and every threshold graph is split,
Theorem 1.1 gives, in particular, the linear-error bound \(\operatorname{cp}(G)\le n^2/6+Cn\)
for all threshold graphs, with the same sharp leading constant witnessed inside that subclass.

## 10.5 Localized effectivity near \(q=2p\)

### Proposition 10.1 — Explicit corridor bounds

Let \(q=2p-s\) and \(n=p+q\).

1. If
   \[
   p\ge36,
   \qquad
   0\le s\le6\sqrt p,
   \]
   then
   \[
   \boxed{
   \Phi(G)\le\frac{n^2}{6}+2n.
   }
   \tag{10.2}
   \]

2. If
   \[
   p\ge2304,
   \qquad
   6\sqrt p\le s\le\frac p8,
   \]
   and every \(v\in I\) satisfies
   \[
   d(v)>\frac{2n-1}{6}+1,
   \]
   then
   \[
   \boxed{
   \Phi(G)\le\frac{n^2}{6}.
   }
   \tag{10.3}
   \]

Consequently, for every \(C\ge2\), a minimum-order counterexample to

\[
\Phi(G)\le\frac{n^2}{6}+Cn
\]

cannot satisfy

\[
p\ge2304,
\qquad
0\le s\le\frac p8.
\]

### Proof

For the short corridor, inequality (5.3) and \(s^2\le36p\) give

\[
\Phi(G)-\frac{n^2}{6}
\le
\frac{7p}{2}+\frac14
\le
2n,
\]

because \(p\ge36\) implies \(s\le p\) and hence \(n=3p-s\ge2p\).

The mesoscopic assertion is exactly the quantitative high/low-dispersion calculation in Section 9.3. The final consequence follows from the degree inequality obtained by deleting an independent vertex from a minimum-order counterexample. \(\square\)

---

# 11. Discussion

## 11.1 From fractional asymptotics to a linear-error integral theorem

The central difficulty is that the general theorem

\[
\nu_3^*(G)-\nu_3(G)=o(n^2)
\]

has no linear rate. The present proof avoids demanding one uniform rounding mechanism.

- In the bulk, the common-profile LP produces quadratic slack.
- Near \(q=2p\), explicit factorization structures replace general rounding.
- Near \(q=0\), the residual clique becomes dense enough for exact decomposition.

This regime-dependent strategy is weaker than a universal linear integrality-gap theorem but sufficient for the extremal clique-partition problem.

## 11.2 Why residual maximum degree is not the right invariant

Early exploratory work attempted to prove that an optimal packing leaves a clique residual of bounded maximum degree. Numerical behavior depended strongly on the packing algorithm, and no such property is needed in the final proof.

The effective invariants are instead:

- the common-profile fractional margin;
- the variance term \(S_2\);
- the polarization energy \(V\);
- the centered deviations \(A_R,B_R\);
- divisibility of the dense residual.

## 11.3 Localized effectivity and remaining non-effectivity

Proposition 10.1 shows that the entire near-extremal corridor treated by factorization, polarization, and shifted-center completion is quantitatively effective. One may take

\[
C_{\mathrm{corr}}=2,
\qquad
p_0=2304,
\qquad
s_0(p)=6\sqrt p,
\qquad
\eta_0=\frac18.
\]

The global constant \(C\) remains non-effective for two independent reasons.

1. The Haxell--Rödl theorem is used through an asymptotic \(o(n^2)\) statement in the bulk.
2. Dense triangle decomposition theorems are invoked with unspecified sufficiently-large thresholds in the sparse-independent regime.

Thus no hidden non-effectivity remains in Sections 5--7; it comes only from the two external asymptotic inputs above. Moreover, after Appendix D, Sections 5--7 are self-contained: Proposition 10.1 depends on no external theorem whatsoever.

## 11.4 Relationship with the fractional extremal theorem

The complete-split extremal theorem determines the global fractional maximum of

\[
|E(G)|-2\nu_3^*(G)
\]

over both split and chordal graphs. The common-profile LP in the present paper serves a different purpose: it is a profile-sensitive local lower bound for the replicated graph, and its quantitative slack absorbs integrality loss away from the extremal corridor.

Thus the global fractional extremal calculation and the local common-profile calculation are compatible but logically distinct. The present proof is self-contained apart from the external theorems stated in Section 2.

**Remark (cloning across the series).** Lemma 4.1 and the clone-symmetrization step of Paper II use the same underlying operation in different roles. Paper II uses pairwise cloning to move a chordal graph toward a complete-split terminal graph. Lemma 4.1 uses \(q\)-fold cloning on the cover side to compare an arbitrary profile with a common-profile graph. The shared term *cloning* is therefore retained, while the qualifier *fractional* distinguishes the present inequality.

## 11.5 Relationship with the chordal linear-error problem

The complete-split reduction settles the asymptotically sharp chordal bound

\[
\operatorname{cp}(G)
\le
\left(\frac16+o(1)\right)n^2.
\]

The stronger estimate

\[
\operatorname{cp}(G)
\le
\frac{n^2}{6}+O(n)
\]

remains open for general chordal graphs. The mechanisms developed here suggest a concrete three-part program for that problem.

1. **Stability of the fractional extremal theorem.** Upgrade the exact chordal fractional theorem of Paper II to a stability statement: every chordal graph whose value is within \(\delta n^2\) of the fractional maximum is within \(\varepsilon n^2\) edge edits of a maximizing complete split graph. Away from near-extremality, the quadratic fractional slack absorbs the general integrality loss exactly as in Section 4.

2. **Robust corridor mechanisms.** Extend the factorization, polarization, and shifted-center arguments of Sections 5--7 from split graphs to \(\varepsilon n^2\)-perturbations of complete split graphs, so that they apply to the near-extremal graphs produced by stability.

3. **Clique-tree assembly.** Patch the local estimates across the clique tree by an edge-ownership ledger that preserves separator capacities, in the spirit of shifted-center completion, so that no edge is charged twice.

A chordal linear-error proof would still have to preserve ownership and separator capacities across the clique tree; the ledger of step 3 is designed for exactly that purpose.

A companion paper in preparation investigates this program. Its intended clique-separator recursion uses the split theorem proved here as the base case and is designed so that the chordal regimes mirror the corresponding ingredients of Sections 3--9: common-profile evaluation, fractional cloning, factorization, and corridor analysis. Until that companion argument is complete, this paragraph records the proposed interface rather than a theorem of the present paper.

## 11.6 Formal-verification perimeter and current status

Papers I and II of the series are formally verified in Lean 4 with Mathlib. Paper III is being verified under the same release protocol. The Lean project for the present manuscript is built against Mathlib v4.28.0 and currently compiles as a complete dependency graph.

The formal development separates two layers.

- **Layer X** contains exactly the two external asymptotic inputs, Theorems 2.1 and 2.3, retained as named axioms with their hypotheses stated explicitly.
- **Layer E** contains the finite mathematical core: Theorems 3.1 and 4.2; Lemmas 4.1--7.1; the divisibility correction of Appendix B; the list edge coloring development of Appendix D; the quantitative chains of Sections 9.3 and 10.5; Proposition 10.1; and the final assembly.

At the date of this draft, the project has eight localized `sorry` obligations. They are confined to: the small degenerate cases of the common-profile LP; the one- and double-factor rounding block of Section 5; the middle-corridor conclusion of Proposition 10.1; one matching helper in the self-contained Galvin/König development; the three-family packing construction underlying Section 7.2; and the sparse-regime packing estimate that invokes Theorem 2.3. The statement and dependency assembly of Theorem 1.1 already compile, but the theorem remains transitively open until these leaves are discharged.

No computation or regression script is a premise of the proof. The exact-arithmetic and integer-programming checks are supplementary audits. Using one consistent counting convention, they comprise 46,390 exact-arithmetic and LP checks and 91 exact ILP checks, for a total of 46,481 checks, with no reported discrepancy.

The public-preprint status line will be updated only after all of the following are frozen: a zero-`sorry` build, the axiom report, the Lean toolchain and manifest, and the release commit. The intended final claim is therefore already delimited, but it is not asserted in this draft.

# 12. Potential Uses and Future Directions

## 12.1 Universal linear integrality gap

### Problem 12.1

Is there an absolute constant \(C\) such that

\[
\nu_3^*(G)-\nu_3(G)
\le C|V(G)|
\]

for every split graph \(G\)?

The present paper supplies supporting structures near the extremal corridor but does not resolve the bulk regime without quadratic slack.

## 12.2 Effective global constants

### Problem 12.2

Find an explicit global constant \(C\) in Theorem 1.1.

The near-extremal corridor is already effective by Proposition 10.1. A fully quantitative global theorem therefore requires only explicit rates in fractional-to-integral packing, or a structured replacement for Haxell--Rödl in the bulk, together with effective dense-decomposition thresholds in the sparse-independent regime.

## 12.3 Algorithmic packing

The proof contains polynomially implementable pieces:

- complete-graph factorizations;
- weighted selection of reserved vertices;
- bipartite list edge coloring;
- matching extraction;
- dense decomposition algorithms implicit in iterative absorption.

It is natural to seek a polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a clique partition of size

\[
\frac{n^2}{6}+O(n)
\]

with an explicit constant. The factorization, list-coloring, and matching steps of Sections 5--7 are individually polynomial; assembling them into a single approximation algorithm with a proven guarantee is left to future work.

### Corollary 12.2 — Effective corridor algorithm

In the near-extremal corridor covered by Proposition 10.1 (explicit \(p_0,s_0\)), the proof is
constructive: the one- and double-factorizations of \(K_p\), the reserved-vertex selection, the
list edge coloring (Appendix D, whose kernel/stable-pairing proof is itself an algorithm), and
the matching extraction all run in polynomial time. Hence there is a deterministic
polynomial-time algorithm that, for split graphs in the effective corridor, outputs a clique
partition of size \(n^2/6+2n\) with the explicit constant of Proposition 10.1. Outside the
corridor the guarantee currently relies on the non-constructive bulk input (Theorem 2.1); a
fully effective global algorithm is left to future work.

## 12.4 Stability and extremal classification

### Problem 12.3

Characterize split graphs satisfying

\[
\operatorname{cp}(G)
\ge
\frac{n^2}{6}-o(n^2).
\]

The proof suggests that near-extremal graphs should have \(|I|=(2+o(1))|K|\) and low-dispersion absence profiles close to a common center.

Two pieces of evidence support a Simonovits-type stability statement. First, an exhaustive
enumeration at \(n=9\) (all split graphs with \(|K|=3\)) shows that graphs within an additive
constant of the maximum are within a bounded edit distance of the complete-split family, while
genuinely dispersed profiles fall a linear amount below the maximum. Second, the fractional
margin of Theorem 4.2 already yields a level-set bound: away from near-extremality the
quadratic slack \(\mu(\alpha)p^2\) is strictly positive, so any near-maximizer must have
\(\alpha\) near the extremal ratio and small profile dispersion. A full stability theorem
would still require quantifying the gain of a single symmetrization step and controlling the
directions along which \(\Phi^*\) is flat; we leave it as an open problem, most naturally
phrased in the cut (graphon) metric to absorb the choice of nearest complete-split graph.

## 12.5 Higher-clique linear-error packing

The complete-split reduction determines the fractional extremal problem and the first-order integral asymptotics for fixed \(K_r\)-and-edge partitions. The natural higher-clique analogue of the present paper is the following linear-error question.

For fixed \(r\ge3\), does every split graph satisfy

\[
\pi_r(G)
\le
\frac{r-1}{4r}n^2+O_r(n),
\]

where \(\pi_r(G)\) is the minimum number of parts in an edge partition into copies of \(K_r\) and single edges?

The common-profile and cloning ideas suggest one possible approach, but the relevant local orbit programs and integral rounding mechanisms become substantially more complicated. Design and decomposition methods such as those developed by Keevash [10] and the regular-slice framework of Allen, Böttcher, Cooley, and Mycroft [11] may be useful tools; they are not ingredients of the present proof.

## 12.6 Chordal and clique-tree applications

Shifted-center completion was designed to separate owned clique edges from protected interface edges. A parametric version may be useful in a future chordal linear-error theorem, where separators are shared between neighboring maximal cliques.

## 12.7 Reusable proof principle

The paper illustrates a broader strategy:

> Use exact symmetric LPs to create slack away from extremality, then reserve explicit combinatorial rounding only for the corridor where the slack vanishes.

This may apply to other structured packing-covering problems in which a general regularity theorem is too weak at second order.

The manuscript is the mathematical source of truth. `LEDGER.md` is the authoritative dependency specification for the Lean development; the incremental ledger records only the transition from v0.9.1 to this draft. The final release package will add the frozen commit, build log, axiom report, and SHA-256 manifest.

The proof itself is contained in the manuscript. The common-profile optimization is proved in Theorem 3.1; the fractional margin is proved in Theorem 4.2 and Appendix A; the factorization, polarization, and shifted-center inequalities are proved in Lemmas 5.1--7.1; the divisibility correction is proved in Section 8.3 and Appendix B; and the explicit near-extremal constants are proved algebraically in Sections 9.3 and 10.5.

The included script is a supplementary regression test for the explicit corridor constants. Its output is not used as a hypothesis, reduction, or proof step anywhere in the manuscript. Historical exploratory computations are not part of the logical proof package.

# Appendix A. Algebra of the Fractional Margin

Let \(x=d/p\) and \(\alpha=q/p\). Ignoring the exact linear terms temporarily, the three normalized branches of \(F\) are

\[
f_1(x)=\frac16+\frac{\alpha x}{3},
\]

\[
f_2(x)=x^2-x+\frac12,
\]

and

\[
f_3(x)=\frac16+\frac{x^2}{3}.
\]

Subtracting the affine target contribution gives minima

\[
\min_x\left(f_1(x)-\frac{\alpha x}{2}-C_\alpha\right)
=
\frac{\alpha^2}{12},
\]

\[
\min_x\left(f_2(x)-\frac{\alpha x}{2}-C_\alpha\right)
=
\frac{(2-\alpha)^2}{48},
\]

and

\[
\min_x\left(f_3(x)-\frac{\alpha x}{2}-C_\alpha\right)
=
\begin{cases}
\alpha(8-5\alpha)/48,&\alpha\le4/3,\\
(2-\alpha)^2/12,&\alpha\ge4/3.
\end{cases}
\]

The third is dominated by the lower envelope of the first two. Restoring the exact \(-p/2\) contribution in each pointwise estimate and averaging produces the \(-p/4\) term in Theorem 4.2.

---

# Appendix B. Divisibility Correction

Let \(P=x_1\cdots x_p\) be a path and let \(O\subseteq V(P)\) have even cardinality. Define

\[
J=\{x_jx_{j+1}:|O\cap\{x_1,\ldots,x_j\}|\text{ is odd}\}.
\]

Every internal vertex \(x_j\) changes prefix parity precisely when \(x_j\in O\). Therefore

\[
\operatorname{Odd}(J)=O.
\]

Also \(|E(J)|\le p-1\) and \(\Delta(J)\le2\).

After parity correction, the minimum degree has fallen by at most two. In the sparse-independent regime it is still greater than \(3p/4\) for all sufficiently large \(p\), so Turán's theorem supplies a \(K_5\). Deleting a \(C_4\) inside that \(K_5\) changes the edge count by \(1\pmod3\), while deleting a \(C_5\) changes it by \(2\pmod3\). Every affected degree changes by two, so parity is preserved. The total degree loss from the path subgraph and the correcting cycle is at most four. Thus, when \(q=o(p)\), the final graph has minimum degree at least \(p-1-q-4\), which eventually exceeds \((0.9+\varepsilon_0)p\) for any fixed \(0<\varepsilon_0<0.1\).

# Appendix D. Self-Contained List Edge Coloring

This appendix proves the list edge coloring theorem used in Section 7.2 (stated as Theorem 2.2), so that the corridor argument depends on no external coloring theorem. The result is the maximum-degree case of Galvin's theorem [12]; the gain graph of Section 7.2 is simple and bipartite, which is the case proved here.

## D.1 Kernels

A **kernel** of a digraph \(D\) is an independent set \(K\) of vertices such that every vertex outside \(K\) has an out-neighbor in \(K\). \(D\) is **kernel-perfect** if every induced subdigraph has a kernel. A kernel of a nonempty digraph is nonempty.

### Lemma D.1 — Kernel coloring lemma

Let \(D\) be a kernel-perfect digraph in which every vertex \(v\) has a list \(L(v)\) with \(|L(v)|\ge d^+_D(v)+1\). Then the underlying graph of \(D\) has a proper coloring choosing each color from the corresponding list.

### Proof

Pick any color \(c\) appearing in some list, let \(S=\{v:c\in L(v)\}\), and let \(K\) be a kernel of \(D[S]\). Color every vertex of \(K\) with \(c\); this is proper on \(K\) because \(K\) is independent. Delete \(K\) from \(D\) and delete \(c\) from the list of every vertex of \(S\setminus K\). Every \(v\in S\setminus K\) lost one color but also at least one out-neighbor, namely its out-neighbor in \(K\), so the hypothesis \(|L(v)|\ge d^+(v)+1\) is preserved; vertices outside \(S\) keep their lists while their out-degrees do not increase. Repeat. Every uncolored vertex always has a nonempty list, and each round with \(S\ne\varnothing\) colors the nonempty set \(K\), so every vertex is eventually colored. \(\square\)

## D.2 Stable pairings

Let \(B\) be a bipartite graph with parts \(U\) and \(R\) in which every vertex \(z\) has a linear preference order \(>_z\) on its incident edges. A matching \(M\subseteq E(B)\) is **stable** if every edge \(f\notin M\) has an endpoint \(z\) that is covered by an edge \(e\in M\) with \(e>_zf\).

### Lemma D.2 — Gale--Shapley [13]

For every system of preferences, a stable matching exists.

### Proof

Run deferred acceptance. While some \(u\in U\) is unmatched and has not yet proposed along all of its edges, let \(u\) propose along its most preferred untried edge, say \(f\) with endpoint \(r\in R\). If \(r\) is unmatched, or prefers \(f\) to its currently held edge, then \(r\) accepts \(f\), releasing its previous partner, if any; otherwise \(r\) rejects \(f\). Every edge is proposed at most once, so the process terminates, and it terminates in a matching \(M\).

Let \(f=ur\notin M\). Suppose first that \(u\) proposed along \(f\) at some point. Then \(r\) either rejected \(f\) immediately or accepted it and later released it; in both cases, at that moment \(r\) held or received an edge it strictly prefers to \(f\). Since the edge held by \(r\) only improves during the process, the final edge \(e\in M\) at \(r\) satisfies \(e>_rf\). Suppose instead that \(u\) never proposed along \(f\). An unmatched vertex of \(U\) keeps proposing while untried edges remain, so at termination \(u\) is matched, say to \(e\in M\); and since \(u\) proposes in decreasing order of preference and never reached \(f\), we have \(e>_uf\). In both cases \(f\) has an endpoint whose matched edge is preferred to \(f\). \(\square\)

## D.3 The coloring theorem

### Theorem D.3 — Galvin, maximum-degree case

Let \(B\) be a simple bipartite graph with maximum degree \(\Delta\), and let every edge \(e\) carry a list \(L(e)\) with \(|L(e)|\ge\Delta\). Then \(B\) has a proper edge coloring choosing each color from the corresponding list.

### Proof

**Step 1: a proper \(\Delta\)-edge-coloring.** By König's edge coloring theorem [14], \(B\) has a proper edge coloring \(\varphi:E(B)\to\{1,\ldots,\Delta\}\). For completeness: induct on the number of edges. Remove an edge \(e=ur\) and color the rest. At most \(\Delta-1\) colors appear at \(u\) and at most \(\Delta-1\) at \(r\), so \(u\) misses a color \(\alpha\) and \(r\) misses a color \(\beta\). If they miss a common color, give it to \(e\). Otherwise consider the maximal path \(P\) starting at \(u\) whose edges are colored alternately \(\beta,\alpha\). The path \(P\) cannot end at \(r\): since \(r\) misses \(\beta\), such a path would end with an \(\alpha\)-edge and hence have even length, while every path between the adjacent vertices \(u\) and \(r\) of a bipartite graph has odd length. Swap the colors \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) along \(P\); by maximality of \(P\) the coloring stays proper, the vertex \(r\) is untouched, and \(u\) now misses \(\beta\). Give \(\beta\) to \(e\).

**Step 2: the orientation.** Define preferences from \(\varphi\): every \(u\in U\) prefers its incident edges with **higher** \(\varphi\)-color, every \(r\in R\) prefers **lower** \(\varphi\)-color. Define a digraph \(D\) on the vertex set \(E(B)\): for distinct edges \(e,f\) sharing an endpoint \(z\), put an arc \(e\to f\) exactly when \(f>_ze\).

Out-degrees: let \(e=ur\) with \(\varphi(e)=c\). The out-neighbors of \(e\) are the edges at \(u\) with color greater than \(c\) — at most \(\Delta-c\), since the colors at \(u\) are pairwise distinct — and the edges at \(r\) with color smaller than \(c\) — at most \(c-1\). Hence

\[
d^+_D(e)\le(\Delta-c)+(c-1)=\Delta-1.
\]

**Step 3: kernel-perfectness.** An induced subdigraph of \(D\) is \(D[S]\) for a set \(S\) of edges of \(B\). A kernel of \(D[S]\) is exactly a stable matching of the subgraph \((V(B),S)\) with the inherited preferences: independence in \(D\) means that no two kernel edges share an endpoint, because two edges at a common vertex are always joined by an arc; and the domination condition asks that every \(f\in S\setminus K\) have an arc into \(K\), that is, an endpoint \(z\) and an edge \(e\in K\) at \(z\) with \(e>_zf\), which is stability. Lemma D.2 provides a stable matching, so \(D\) is kernel-perfect.

**Step 4: conclusion.** Every edge has \(|L(e)|\ge\Delta\ge d^+_D(e)+1\), so Lemma D.1 yields a proper coloring of the underlying graph of \(D\) from the lists — that is, a proper list edge coloring of \(B\). \(\square\)

### Remark D.4 — Application

The gain graph of Section 7.2 is simple and bipartite, and hypothesis (7.2) bounds every list by \(b-t_i\ge\max\{\rho,u\}\ge\Delta\) of the gain graph. Theorem D.3 therefore applies verbatim. The multigraph version of Galvin's theorem holds as well [12] and is not needed here.
