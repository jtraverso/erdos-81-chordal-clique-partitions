# Nibble — uniformity passes to vertex sub-blocks

The per-triple counting of `Nibble.AX1.uniform_triple_codegree` needs the three triangle-degree
scales of a cluster triple to agree.  One way to equalise them without any probability is to replace
the three clusters `U, W, X` by *sub-blocks* `U' ⊆ U`, `W' ⊆ W`, `X' ⊆ X` of prescribed relative
sizes (see `RESIDUAL.md`, §3(b)).  For that one needs uniformity to be inherited by large subsets,
which Mathlib does not record.  This file supplies it.

* `Nibble.AX1.edgeDensity_sub_lt_of_isUniform` — the density of a pair of subsets of relative size
  at least `α ≥ ε` differs from the density of the pair by less than `ε`.
* `Nibble.AX1.isUniform_subblock` — such a pair of subsets is `(ε/α)`-uniform.

Must be sorry-free and axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

/-- **Uniformity passes to large sub-blocks.**  If `(A, B)` is `ε`-uniform and `A' ⊆ A`, `B' ⊆ B`
have relative size at least `α`, with `ε ≤ α ≤ 1/2`, then `(A', B')` is `(ε/α)`-uniform.

The proof is the obvious one: a subset of `A'` of relative size `ε/α` has absolute size at least
`ε|A|`, so uniformity of `(A, B)` applies to it and to `(A', B')` itself, and the two densities are
each within `ε` of `d(A, B)`, hence within `2ε ≤ ε/α` of each other. -/
