# Nibble — counting bad vertices by Markov's inequality (no union bound)

The corrected nibble route (`Nibble.RoundOracleKernel`) does not need *every* vertex to behave well
after a round — only all but a small FRACTION of them (the exceptional set of
`Nibble.CeilRoundInv`).  This is essential: the degree scale `d` is not tied to `|V|`, so a union
bound over the `|V|` vertices of a per-vertex failure probability is unavailable.

What replaces it is Markov's inequality applied to the *number* of bad vertices: if every vertex
fails with probability at most `q`, then the expected number of failures is at most `q|V|`, so the
probability that more than a `δ`-fraction of the vertices fail is at most `q/δ` — a bound that is
small as soon as the per-vertex failure probability `q` is small compared to `δ`, with no dependence
on `|V|` whatsoever.

Sorry-free and axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
