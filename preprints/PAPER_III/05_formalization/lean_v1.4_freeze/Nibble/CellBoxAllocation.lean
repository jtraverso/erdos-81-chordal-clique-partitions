# Nibble — the **box (interval-cell) allocation** of the coarse-cell route, and why it is
infeasible at general densities

The coarse-cell route to `Nibble.AX1.BlockCoverResidualCoupled` needs, for every cluster pair, an
allocation of the cell grid of the pair among the cluster triples through it, coherent along the
three cluster axes.  `Nibble.CoarseCellLatinFill` supplies the *filling* of one **product box**
`I_S × I_T × I_Y` (a set of coarse cells per cluster) with no waste; what is left is the
**allocation** of the boxes.

Two copies of cluster triples that share the cluster pair `{S,T}` occupy the rectangles
`I_S × I_T` and `I_S' × I_T'` of the `(S,T)` cell grid, and these must be disjoint, i.e.

    Disjoint I_S I_S' ∨ Disjoint I_T I_T'                      (`Nibble.AX1.BoxCompat`)

The shape of a box is *forced* by the densities: with `p`, `q`, `s` blocks per coarse cell of
`S`, `T`, `Y` (so `p : q : s = 1/d(T,Y) : 1/d(S,Y) : 1/d(S,T)`, the block sizes being
`τ·(opposite density)`), a box occupies `q·s` cells of `S` and `p·s` cells of `T`, so the aspect
ratio of the `(S,T)` rectangle is `q : p = d(T,Y) : d(S,Y)` — it is dictated by the *other* two
pairs, and ranges over `[δ, 1/δ]`.

`Nibble.AX1.box_allocation_infeasible` is the resulting obstruction in its sharpest form: with `P`
coarse cells per cluster, a triple `(S,T,Y)` with `d(T,Y) = 1`, `d(S,Y) = 1/P` and a triple
`(S,T,Y')` with `d(T,Y') = 1/P`, `d(S,Y') = 1` demand rectangles of shapes `P × 1` and `1 × P` in
the `(S,T)` grid; their total area `2P` is a vanishing fraction of the capacity `P²`, yet no
placement is compatible.  Interval (box) cells therefore cannot realise the LP allocation at
general densities, whatever the accuracy asked for — this is the "over-determination" the shape
gate `Nibble.CoarseCellShapeGate` describes, in allocation form.

Must be sorry-free and axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
