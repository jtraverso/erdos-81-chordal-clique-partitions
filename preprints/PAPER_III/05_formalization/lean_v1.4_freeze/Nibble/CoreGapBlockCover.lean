# Nibble — the AX1 residual reduced to a **deterministic block-allocation** problem

This file performs the last analytic step of the deterministic (probability-free) route to AX1.

`Nibble.AX1.SubTripleDesignLocalResidual` (`Nibble.CoreGapGridLocalResidual`) asks, for every
triangle-rich regularity-reduced graph, for a whole *local sub-triple design*: uniformity,
densities, the six scale-equalisation windows, the pruning budget, the edge counts and the recovery
of `ν₃*`.  Here all of that is discharged, and what is left is a purely combinatorial statement
about **allocating blocks**:

`Nibble.AX1.BlockCoverResidual` — for every accuracy `ε`, density threshold `δ`, relative block size
`α`, scale floor `T₀` and regularity scale `ε₁`, every large enough regularity-reduced graph admits
a common block scale `τ ≥ T₀` and a finite family of block sub-triples
(`Nibble.AX1.IsGridSubTriple`: blocks of size `≈ τ·(opposite density)` and relative size at least
`α` inside the clusters of a good triple) whose **vertex-pair rectangles are pairwise disjoint**
(`Nibble.AX1.tripleRect`) and which carry the fractional optimum:
`ν₃*(reduced) ≤ (∑ᵢ dᵢ·areaᵢ)/3 + ε|V|²`.

There is no probability, no regularity argument and no counting lemma left in that statement: it is
the deterministic rectangle-packing problem of allocating, inside each cluster pair, the block
rectangles used by the cluster triples through that pair.

* `Nibble.AX1.subTripleDesignLocalResidual_of_blockCover` — **the reduction**;
* `Nibble.AX1.ax1_of_blockCover` — AX1 from the block-allocation residual.

The block scale `τ` is large (`8 ≤ τ·δ`), the blocks have size between `¾τδ` and `⁵⁄₄τ`, and the
regularity scale `ε₁` is small compared with `δ`, `μ₂` and `η`.  The four lemmas below are the only
computations the reduction needs; they are stated in isolation to keep the context small. -/

/-- **The deterministic block-allocation residual.**  At every choice of accuracy `ε`, density
threshold `δ`, relative block size `α ≤ δ/2`, scale floor `T₀` and regularity scale `ε₁`, all large
regularity-reduced graphs carry a family of block sub-triples with pairwise disjoint vertex-pair
rectangles whose edges recover the fractional triangle-packing optimum up to `ε|V|²`.

The bound `α ≤ δ/2` on the relative size of the blocks is not cosmetic, it is forced: the sizes
`#A ≈ τ·d(W,X)`, `#B ≈ τ·d(U,X)`, `#C ≈ τ·d(U,W)` of `Nibble.AX1.IsGridSubTriple` are proportional
to the three cluster densities, and `A ⊆ U` etc., so all three of `#A/#U`, `#B/#W`, `#C/#X` can be
at least `α` only when the three densities are within a factor `1/α` of each other.  Demanding a
*constant* `α` would therefore make the statement false: a graph all of whose good cluster triples
have density profile `(1, 1/10, 1/10)` — three groups of clusters, dense across the first two,
sparse to the third — admits no sub-triple at all at `α = 1/4`, while its reduced graph has `ν₃*`
of order `|V|²`.  Since the densities are at least `δ`, `α = δ/2` is the natural scale, and that is
the value at which `Nibble.AX1.subTripleDesignLocalResidual_of_blockCover` uses the residual. -/

/-! ### The residual at a **fine** relative block size

`Nibble.AX1.BlockCoverResidual` above is stated at every relative block size `α ≤ δ / 2`, but the
reduction only ever uses it at the *one* value `α = δ / 2` with a density threshold `δ` that the
reduction itself chooses, and which is free to be small compared with the accuracy `ε`.  Recording
that coupling is not a cosmetic change: at `α` comparable with `δ` and `δ` comparable with `1` the
statement is **false** — the blocks are then forced to occupy a constant fraction of their cluster,
so only boundedly many rectangles fit into a cluster pair, and the resulting quantisation error is a
fixed positive multiple of `|V| ^ 2`.  This is proved in `Nibble.CoreGapBlockCoverRefute`
(`Nibble.AX1.not_blockCoverResidual`), with the explicit witness `δ = 1`, `α = 1/2`, `ε₁ = 1`,
`ε = 1/1000` and the complete graph split into five equal clusters.

`Nibble.AX1.BlockCoverResidualFine` is the same statement carrying the two side conditions the
reduction actually supplies, `δ ≤ ε` and `α ≤ ε ^ 2`; it is implied by `BlockCoverResidual`
(`Nibble.AX1.blockCoverResidualFine_of_blockCover`) and it still yields AX1
(`Nibble.AX1.ax1_of_blockCoverFine`).  Both conditions are exactly what a construction needs:
`δ ≤ ε` lets the cluster triples of density below the threshold be discarded at a cost of at most
`ε|V| ^ 2`, and `α ≤ ε ^ 2` makes the blocks small compared with their clusters, which is what
turns the rounding of a fractional cluster packing to the quantised block sizes into an `O(ε|V|^2)`
error. -/

/-- **The deterministic block-allocation residual at a fine relative block size.**  Same as
`Nibble.AX1.BlockCoverResidual`, but only for the parameter range the reduction uses: the density
threshold `δ` is below the accuracy `ε`, and the relative block size `α` is below `ε ^ 2`. -/

/-! ### What is left in `Nibble.AX1.BlockCoverResidual`, and what it is not

The residual is now purely a statement about **placing rectangles**, and the accounting inside it is
exact.  Writing `p = d(U,W)`, `q = d(U,X)`, `r = d(W,X)` for the three cluster densities of the
triple carrying the `i`-th sub-triple, the scale-equalisation sizes `#A ≈ τr`, `#B ≈ τq`,
`#C ≈ τp` of `Nibble.AX1.IsGridSubTriple` make the three terms of the covering clause *equal*:

`p·#A·#B = q·#A·#C = r·#B·#C = τ²·p·q·r`,

so each sub-triple contributes exactly `τ²pqr` to `(∑ᵢ covᵢ)/3`, while the rectangles it occupies in
the three cluster pairs have areas `τ²qr`, `τ²pr`, `τ²pq`.  Summing the disjointness constraint over
the cluster triples through one pair `(U, W)` therefore reads

`∑_X (number of sub-triples on (U,W,X)) · τ²·d(U,X)·d(W,X) ≤ #U·#W`,

i.e. exactly the capacity constraint `∑_X z_{UWX} ≤ e(U,W)` of the **fractional triangle packing LP
of the weighted cluster graph**, with `z_{UWX}` the value contributed by that cluster triple.  And
on the LP side a fractional triangle packing of the reduced graph respects exactly those capacities:
`Nibble.AX1.sum_fracPacking_cluster_pair_le` (`Nibble.CoreGapClusterCapacity`) bounds the weight it
puts on the triangles using a `U–W` edge by `e(U, W)`.  (That the aggregated weights are an optimal
LP solution, and hence that the LP optimum bounds `ν₃*`, is the informal reading of that constraint;
only the per-pair constraint itself is formalised.)  In other words `Nibble.AX1.BlockCoverResidual` is precisely the statement that an (almost) optimal
solution of that cluster LP can be **realised** by an edge-disjoint family of block rectangles: the
fractional-to-integral step in a blow-up.

Three things about the shape of that residual are settled, and none of them can be traded away.

* The `ν₃*` clause cannot be replaced by "cover all but `ε|V|²` of the triangle-carrying edges".
  That stronger covering criterion is available (`Nibble.AX1.hasNearRegularFamily_of_cover`) but is
  in general unsatisfiable: as explained at the end of `Nibble.CoreGapRegularCover`, a cluster
  triple with densities `1, 1/10, 1/10` can have only about `3/10` of its edges covered by
  near-regular classes, while every one of its edges lies in a triangle.
* The *global* exceptional-edge rate of `Nibble.AX1.SubTripleDesignResidual` cannot be met by any
  construction whose sub-triples live inside clusters — see the head of
  `Nibble.CoreGapGridLocalResidual` — which is why the route here goes through
  `Nibble.AX1.SubTripleDesignLocalResidual`.
* Allocating to each cluster triple a private *piece of each cluster* (so that rectangles of
  different triples are disjoint because their blocks already are) is far too lossy.  With `m`
  clusters of size `N` and all densities `1`, the LP value is `≈ m²N²/6`, whereas maximising
  `∑_T g_T²τ²` under the per-cluster constraints `∑_{T ∋ U} g_T τ ≤ N` — there are `≈ m²/2` triples
  through each cluster — gives only `≈ 2N²/(3m)`, short by a factor `≈ m³`.  Blocks must therefore
  be **reused** by many cluster triples, disjointness coming from the *other* coordinate of the
  rectangle.

That is what the line design of `Nibble.GridLineDesign` is for.  Indexing the blocks of each cluster
by `ZMod q`, the line `L(a,b) = {(j, j+a, j+b) : j}` is a family of `q` sub-triples whose three
projections are the diagonal `a` of `(U,W)`, the diagonal `b` of `(U,X)` and the diagonal `b-a` of
`(W,X)` (`Nibble.AX1.lineTriple_UW_unique`, `Nibble.AX1.lineTriple_UX_unique`,
`Nibble.AX1.lineTriple_WX_unique`); the `q` diagonals of a pair partition its `q²` block pairs
(`Nibble.AX1.diagIndex_bijective`, the partial form of `Nibble.AX1.gridUW_bijective`); and two
cluster triples through the same pair that receive disjoint sets of diagonals never collide
(`Nibble.AX1.lineTriple_pair_disjoint`), which is where `Nibble.AX1.balanced_bucket_le` allocates.

The **simultaneous consistency** of those allocations — the diagonals handed to a cluster triple in
its three pairs have to be the three projections of one family of lines, at the same time for every
pair of the cluster graph — is now settled, in closed form and deterministically, by
`Nibble.GridTripleDesign` and `Nibble.GridTripleDesignRect`.  Indexing both the clusters and the
blocks of each cluster by a prime field `ZMod q`, give the cluster triple of vertex sum `s` the
quadratic shift `triShift s v = v ^ 2 - v * s`, so that its `j`-th sub-triple occupies the block
`j + triShift s v` of the cluster `v`.  In the pair `{a, b}` this is the diagonal of offset
`(b - a) * (a + b - s)` (`Nibble.AX1.triShift_diff`), an injective function of `s` for `a ≠ b`; two
distinct cluster triples through a common pair have different sums, so they never share a block
pair, in all three of their pairs at once (`Nibble.AX1.triPairSet_disjoint`,
`Nibble.AX1.triCells_inter_subsingleton`), and the resulting vertex-pair rectangles are pairwise
disjoint (`Nibble.AX1.tripleRect_disjoint_of_design`).  A cluster pair is filled by exactly
`q · (number of cluster triples through it)` of its `q ^ 2` block pairs
(`Nibble.AX1.card_triPairSet_biUnion`), so the allocation is feasible whenever `q` is at least the
number of clusters.

What is still missing is therefore not the consistency of the allocation but the **quantitative
realisation of the LP optimum** under the two side conditions the residual carries.

* *Sizes.* `Nibble.AX1.IsGridSubTriple` prescribes the three part sizes `#A ≈ τ·r`, `#B ≈ τ·q`,
  `#C ≈ τ·p` from a single global scale `τ`, so the rectangles of the family are not free: their
  side lengths are dictated by the cluster densities, and the fractional solution has to be rounded
  to those quantised sizes.
* *Relative size.* The same predicate asks each part to be at least an `α` fraction of its cluster
  (this is what makes the parts inherit `ε₁/(8α)`-uniformity), while `α` has to stay large compared
  with `ε₁`, and the number of clusters is at least `4/ε₁`.  Hence at most `1/α²` rectangles fit in
  a cluster pair, far fewer than the `≈ m` cluster triples through it: the family must be *sparse*,
  using few and large sub-triples rather than a fine grid.  In that regime the design above is used
  with a small number `q` of blocks per cluster, and choosing which cluster triples carry the LP
  mass becomes an **approximate weighted triangle decomposition of the cluster graph** — for the
  all-densities-`1` reduced graph it is exactly an approximate Steiner triple system on the
  clusters, each cluster pair being used once at full size.

That decomposition step, and the rounding of the LP solution to the quantised sizes, is what
`Nibble.AX1.BlockCoverResidual` still asserts. -/
