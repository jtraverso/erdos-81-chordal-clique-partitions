# Nibble — the tight round with a CHEBYSHEV coverage guarantee

`Nibble.exists_tight_round_on` extracts a good outcome by making two failure probabilities add up to
less than one:

* "too many bad vertices", controlled by Markov, probability `≤ N(Vb/t² + Pb/s)/a`;
* "too little coverage", controlled by Markov applied to the UNCOVERED count, probability
  `≤ 1 − q/2`.

Because the second bound is only `1 − q/2`, the first has to be `< q/2 ≈ γ/2`; with `a = θN` this
forces `Vb/t² + Pb/s ≤ θγ`, hence (since `Pb ≈ Δγ²`) `s ≳ γΔ/θ`.  A band of width `≍ γΔ` cannot be
iterated: over the `≍ γ^{-1}log(1/β)` rounds of a nibble it accumulates to a relative error
`≍ log(1/β)/θ ≫ 1`.

Here the coverage is instead controlled by CHEBYSHEV, using the variance bound
`Nibble.coveredCount_variance_le`.  The coverage failure probability becomes `4·Var/Q²`, which is
`≤ 1/2` under hypotheses on the vertex count and the codegree ALONE.  The badness budget is then a
constant rather than `γ`, so `Vb/t² + Pb/s ≤ θ/2` suffices and one may take

  `s ≍ Δγ²/θ`  and  `t ≍ γ²Δ`,

i.e. deviations of relative size `γ²`, whose accumulation over `γ^{-1}log(1/β)` rounds is
`≍ γ·log(1/β) → 0`.  This is the form of the round the iteration needs.

/-- **The tight round with Chebyshev coverage.**

There is an outcome of the nibble round which

* leaves fewer than `a` vertices outside the two-sided safe-degree band of width `2t + s` around
  `deg(v) − 𝔼[loss(v)]`, and
* covers more than `Q/2` vertices,

provided the Markov badness bound `N(Vb/t² + Pb/s)/a` and the Chebyshev coverage bound
`Cvar/(Q/2)²` add up to less than `1`.

Compared with `Nibble.exists_tight_round_on`, the coverage failure probability is `Cvar/(Q/2)²`
instead of `1 − q/2`: the badness budget is a constant instead of `O(q)`. -/
