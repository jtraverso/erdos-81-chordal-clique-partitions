# Nibble — Yuster (edge-based) : the triangle hypergraph for EDGE-disjoint packing

Standalone, Mathlib-only. The **correct** triangle hypergraph for the Yuster route to AX1
(`ν₃*−ν₃ = o(n²)`): Paper III §2.2 defines the fractional triangle packing by the per-EDGE constraint
(total weight through every edge ≤ 1), so `ν₃` is the maximum number of **edge-disjoint** triangles.

Accordingly the ground set is the EDGES of `G` — represented here as `2`-element vertex subsets — and
each triangle contributes the hyperedge of its three edges (`t.powersetCard 2`). A MATCHING of this
hypergraph is a set of triangles sharing no edge, i.e. an edge-disjoint triangle packing = `ν₃`.
(The earlier `Nibble.Yuster.triangleHypergraph = G.cliqueFinset 3` is the VERTEX-clique hypergraph,
whose matchings are vertex-disjoint triangles — a different quantity, superseded for AX1.)

Using `2`-subsets instead of `Sym2` keeps `3`-uniformity clean: `|t.powersetCard 2| = C(3,2) = 3`.

Must be sorry-free and axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
