# Nibble — scale equalisation for the sub-block grid

One triple of clusters `U, W, X` of a regularity-reduced graph, with pair densities `x = d(U,W)`,
`y = d(U,X)`, `z = d(W,X)` all at least `δ`, is split into vertex blocks whose sizes are
proportional to the *opposite* density (`|X-block| ≈ τ·z`, and symmetrically).  The point of that
choice is that the triangle degree of an edge of the `U × W` block pair, which is (up to the
uniformity error) `d(U,X)·d(W,X)·|X-block|`, then sits in the window `(1 ± μ)·d` around the *same*
scale `d = τ·x·y·z` for all three of the pairs — the hypotheses `hClo … hAhi` of
`Nibble.AX1.IsSubTripleDesign`.

`Nibble.AX1.scale_window` is that computation, in the abstract: `x'` and `y'` are the *measured*
sub-block densities (within `e` of the cluster densities `x`, `y`), `ε` is the uniformity slack of
the codegree count, and `s` is the integer block size (within `1` of `τ·z`).  Provided the total
error `e + 2ε` is at most `μδ³/12` and the scale `τ` is at least `2/(μδ³)`, the resulting count lies
in `[(1−μ)d, (1+μ)d]`.

Must be sorry-free and axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

/-- **Scale equalisation.**  If the three cluster densities `x, y, z` lie in `[δ, 1]`, the measured
