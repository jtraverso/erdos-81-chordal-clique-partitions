Paper IV — Tuza–Vizing (line-graph) interface, Tier 1 (v0.9.15 candidate).

The structural, Vizing-free core of the line-graph specialization (see `../ROUTE_TUZA_VIZING.md`).
For a SIMPLE graph `G`, a set of edges is independent in the line graph `L(G)` exactly when its
edges are pairwise vertex-disjoint — i.e. it is a matching. Instantiating the cover-defect corollary
`cover_defect_lower` (Cor 3.2a) at `H := L(G)` then reads the splitting principle in matching /
edge-colouring language: `|E(G)| − 2·(matching size) ≤ oct(L(G))`.

Blocked, hence NOT here (Mathlib gaps, → manuscript): chromatic index `χ'`, Vizing's theorem, and the
multigraph `M_C` with parallel edges (Mathlib's `lineGraph` is for simple graphs). See the route doc.

/-! ### Tier 2 — multigraph line graph (handles parallel edges of `M_C`)

Mathlib's `lineGraph` is defined for simple graphs. The private-witness graph `H[X_C] ≅ L(M_C)` needs
`M_C` to be a MULTIGRAPH on `B = E(G)∖C` (parallel labelled edges). We model a multigraph directly by
its incidence map `ends : E → Sym2 B` (edge labels `E`; a parallel pair is two labels with equal ends)
and define its line graph as a `SimpleGraph E`. This strictly generalises `SimpleGraph.lineGraph`
(`lineGraph_eq_multiLineGraph`), so the matching/edge-colouring corollaries carry over verbatim. -/
