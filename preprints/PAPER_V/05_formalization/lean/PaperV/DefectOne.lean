Paper IV/V — The `q = 1` defect and the scope of the edge-defect profile (Proposition 3.10).

`D_1(H) = |V(H)| − α(H)`: making a graph 1-colourable means keeping an independent set, so the
minimum deletion is the complement of a maximum independent set. On a line graph this reads
`D_1(L(G)) = |E(G)| − ν_match(G)`.

Consequence for Proposition 3.10: `Δ(G)` and the Class 1/2 bit determine WHERE the profile
`q ↦ D_q(L(G))` vanishes, not its positive values. Witness: `L(P₄) ≅ P₃` and `L(C₄) ≅ C₄` (both
`P₄, C₄` have `Δ = 2`), the two line graphs have the same zero set (`D_2 = 0`), but `D_1 = 1` vs `2`.
