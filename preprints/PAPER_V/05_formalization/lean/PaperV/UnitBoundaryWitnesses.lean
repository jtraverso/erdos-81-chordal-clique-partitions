Paper IV — Appendix A closure: (1) glue between the resource model and `ConflictSystem`;
(2) finite witnesses for the unit-boundary kernels and their stated limits (AV5441 §5/§7).

Glue.  `resCS res` is the conflict system "distinct objects whose resource sets meet"; its feasible
sets are exactly the `ResFeasible` families and `nu (resCS res) = packOpt res univ`. So Lemma A / B
are statements about `nu` of a conflict system of Definition 2.1, not a parallel framework.

Witnesses (all by `decide` on `Fin` types; no kernel-bypassing decision procedure):
  W1  duplicated frontier: two outer objects on different pages share one shared resource;
      `packOpt = z + |B| + ν_D(B) = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1`  (Lemma A instance, non-empty).
  W2  weights break Lemma A: a central of weight 100 vs an outer of weight 1 on the same resource;
      every normalized packing has weight 1, a feasible packing has weight 100.
  W3  two shared resources per outer object break the normalization: the outer object blocks two
      disjoint centrals and contributes one; every normalized packing has size 1 < packOpt = 2.
  W4  Lemma B is tight: `h = |B₁ \ B₀| = 1` is attained and the natural inequality holds with equality.
