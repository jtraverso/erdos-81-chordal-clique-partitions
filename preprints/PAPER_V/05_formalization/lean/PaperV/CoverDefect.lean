Paper IV — Corollary 3.2a (private-witness cover defect), v0.9.15 candidate.

At the `H[X_C]` level (distinct private witnesses of an inclusion-minimal resource cover give
`|X_C| = |C|`, i.e. `card V = |C|`), the cover-versus-packing defect is bounded below by the
colourability defect. Immediate from Corollary 3.2 (`splitting_half`).

/-- **Corollary 3.2a.** `∃` feasible packing `S` with `|V| − 2|S| ≤ oct H`. In the triangle system
(resources = edges) with `card V = |C|` this is `τ₃(G) − 2ν₃(G) ≤ oct(H[X_C])`. -/

/-- **Corollary 3.2b (rigidity at equality), core content.** If `q` feasible sets have sizes
summing to `q·ν`, where `ν` bounds every feasible set (the packing number), then all `q` sets are
maximum: `|Sᵢ| = ν`. Applied to the colour classes of a proper `q`-colouring of `H[X_C] − O` at the
equality `D_q = |C| − qν` (sizes summing to `|X_C| − |O| = qν`): every optimal deletion + colouring
splits the surviving witnesses into `q` maximum feasible packings. -/
