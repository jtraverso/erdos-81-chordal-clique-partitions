Paper IV — Proposition 6.2, combinatorial content (termination count of improving repairs).

  * pair uniqueness ⇒ `Assign.ends` is injective on a feasible packing, hence
    `|R| ≤ |cov|` whenever every used pair is coverable (`card_le_cov`);
  * an accepted repair strictly increases `|R|` and lands on a feasible, coverable packing
    (`AcceptedRepair`);
  * therefore any chain of `k` accepted repairs has `k ≤ |cov|` (`accepted_repairs_le_cov`).

The polynomial running time of the scan between repairs is an implementation statement and is
deliberately NOT formalized (manuscript only), as the paper states.
