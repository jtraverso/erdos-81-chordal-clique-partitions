Paper V — Strict separation between colourability and realizability defects (V-G5).

Requests: the `r²` bases `(u, v)` of the complete bipartite graph `K_{r,r}` (left endpoint `u`, right
endpoint `v`), unit weights, multiplicity `1`, `q = 1`, hosts `Fin r`, all lists full.

  Colourability defect: a `1`-colourable (independent) class of `H[X]` is a matching of `K_{r,r}`, so
    `D_1^w(X) = |X| − α(L(K_{r,r})) = r² − r`      (via `Dq_one_eq`).
  Realizability defect (host realizers): the explicit assignment `c(u, v) = u + v (mod r)` is a proper
    list host assignment of ALL bases, so the single class `X` is realized exactly:
    `D_{1,ℛ_host}^w(X) = 0`.

Same multiset, same `q`, same weights, quadratic gap. No Galvin is needed for this instance; the
assignment is explicit. Consequence: all `r²` requests are physically packable with `r` hosts:
`ν(hostCS) = r²`.

Layer E (unconditional): axiom target = {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}.
