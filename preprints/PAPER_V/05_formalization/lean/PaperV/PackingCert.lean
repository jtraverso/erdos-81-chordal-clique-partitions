Paper IV — reusable, kernel-checkable certificates for the packing number `ν` of a conflict
system (Def 2.1, `PaperV.ConflictSystem`).

Two ways of certifying an upper bound on the size of a feasible (= conflict-free) object set,
both of which a concrete instance can discharge by `decide`:

* **clique cover** (`card_le_of_colouring`, `nu_le_of_colouring`): a colouring of the objects by
  `m` colours in which any two distinct objects of the same colour conflict.  A feasible set meets
  each colour class at most once, so it has at most `m` elements.  The certificate is linear in the
  number of objects and is checked in a single pass;
* **pruned branch-and-bound** (`NoPacking`, `card_lt_of_noPacking`, `nu_lt_of_noPacking`): the
  standard "exclude / include the head object" recursion, with the cardinality cut-off `|l| < k`.
  `NoPacking conf fuel k l = true` certifies that no feasible set of size `k` is drawn from `l`.

Both are stated for an arbitrary Boolean *over-approximation* `conf` of the conflict relation, read
through a labelling `f : ι → C.O` of the objects.  Only soundness of `conf` is required — two
objects that the certificate treats as non-conflicting really are non-conflicting — so a concrete
instance may replace the mathematical conflict relation by a packed bit table that the kernel
evaluates with machine-backed `Nat` arithmetic, while the statements stay at the level of
`ConflictSystem`.

/-! ### Branch-and-bound certificates -/

/-- `NoPacking conf fuel k l` is the pruned branch-and-bound search certifying that the objects
labelled by `l` carry no feasible set of size `k` (see `card_lt_of_noPacking`; `fuel` must bound
`l.length`).  Besides the recursion on the head object it uses the cardinality cut-off
`|l| < k`, which is what keeps a kernel evaluation of the certificate small. -/
