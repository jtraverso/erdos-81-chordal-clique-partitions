# Nibble — Module C4b-0' : round-matching membership via conflicts (deterministic bridge)

Standalone, Mathlib-only. Foundation for the Rödl-nibble project.

Bridges the round's matching (`roundMatching`, module C1) with the conflict structure (module
C4b-0): an edge is in the round's matching exactly when it is retained and none of its conflicting
edges is retained. This is the deterministic identity that lets the survival probability
`p·(1-p)^{c(e)}` (module C4b-1) be attached to actual matching membership.

Definitions come from `Nibble.Basic`, `Nibble.Round`, `Nibble.Conflict`. Must be sorry-free and
axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
