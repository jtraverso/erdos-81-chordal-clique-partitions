# Nibble — Module C4b-1 : probability that an edge survives a nibble round

Standalone, Mathlib-only. Foundation for the Rödl-nibble project.

The retention is now modelled as genuine independent **events** `A e` ("edge `e` is retained"),
each with probability `p` (a Bernoulli retention — stronger than the `[0,1]`-mean-`p` indicators of
C2/C3/C4a, which only recorded the mean). An edge `e` ends up in the round's matching exactly when
it is retained and none of its conflicting edges is retained. By independence, that probability
factors as `p · (1-p)^{c(e)}`, where `c(e) = |conflicts H e|`.

`conflicts` comes from `Nibble.Conflict`. Must be sorry-free and axiom-clean
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

/-- **C4b-1 — edge survival probability.** The event that `e` is retained and none of its
conflicting edges is retained has probability `p · (1-p)^{c(e)}`. Proof: the events `A e` and the
complements `(A f)ᶜ` for `f ∈ conflicts H e` are jointly independent (all distinct, since
`conflicts H e` excludes `e`); the measure of their intersection factors as the product
`ℙ(A e) · ∏_{f} ℙ((A f)ᶜ) = p · (1-p)^{c(e)}` (each conflict `f ∈ H`, so `ρ.prob` applies, and
`ℙ((A f)ᶜ) = 1 - p`). -/
