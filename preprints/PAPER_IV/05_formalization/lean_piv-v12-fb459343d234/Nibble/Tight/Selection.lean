# Nibble — generic selection tools

Two elementary tools used to extract a single good outcome of a nibble round.

* `exists_notMem_of_measureReal_add_lt_one` — if two events have total probability `< 1`, some
  outcome avoids both.  (This is what replaces the union bound over vertices: the two events are
  "too many bad vertices" and "too little coverage", and each is controlled by a Markov inequality.)
* `card_filter_mul_le_sum` — the counting form of Markov's inequality: at most `(∑ᵢ gᵢ)/t` indices
  satisfy `t ≤ gᵢ`, for a nonnegative `g`.
* `measureReal_ge_le_integral_div` — the real-valued Markov inequality.

Sorry-free and axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
