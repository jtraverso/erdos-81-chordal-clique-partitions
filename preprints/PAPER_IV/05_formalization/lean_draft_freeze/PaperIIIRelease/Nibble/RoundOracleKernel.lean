# Nibble — the CEILING one-round oracle: invariant, glue, and the residual research core

`Nibble.AdaptiveAssembly` peels the whole outer loop of the nibble down to the single-round atom
`RoundOracleExistsCeil` (all iteration and rate arithmetic being discharged in
`Nibble.AdaptiveRounds`).  This file peels that atom one layer further, isolating the *probabilistic*
content of one nibble round from all of the bookkeeping.

The architecture:

* `loScale`, `hiScale` — the two degree scales of the round schedule.  With retention
  `p_k = 1/(2 r Δ_k)` (so `r Δ_k p_k = 1/2`) a round halves all degrees, up to a relative slack `ε`;
  hence the lower scale `L_k = (d/2)(1/2-ε)^k` and the upper scale `U_k = 2d(1/2+ε)^k`.  Their ratio
  `U_k / L_k = 4·((1/2+ε)/(1/2-ε))^k` stays `≤ 8` for the (bounded) number of rounds that the outer
  loop performs, provided `ε` is small — this is `hiScale_le_eight_loScale`.

* `CeilRoundInv` — the round invariant actually threaded by the oracle.  It says: after `k` rounds
  (with the uncovered count already down to `(1-c)^k|V|`) the current residual contains a
  sub-hypergraph `K` which is `r`-uniform, has small codegree, avoids the covered set `S`, has ALL
  degrees `≤ U_k`, and has degree `≥ L_k` at every still-uncovered vertex outside a small
  exceptional set.  The invariant is *existential over a sub-hypergraph*: this is what allows a round
  to prune the (few) vertices whose residual degree is too large, which is how the global degree
  ceiling is re-established each round without a union bound over the `|V|` vertices.

* `NibbleRoundStep` — ONE nibble round at the current scale: covering a constant fraction of the
  good uncovered vertices, halving the degree scale up to the relative slack `ε`, and growing the
  exceptional set by at most `δ|V|`.

* `NibbleRoundProb` — the intended isolated research core: the PROBABILISTIC half of that round,
  controlling only *fractions* of vertices (all but a `δlow` fraction keep degree `≥ (1/2-ε/2)L`,
  and at most a `blow` fraction exceed the new ceiling).  **It is FALSE**: see
  `Nibble.not_nibbleRoundProb` in `Nibble.RoundProbRefutation` and the long comment before
  `nibbleRoundStep_of_nibbleRoundProb` below.  Its cover clause is true and unconditional
  (`Nibble.exists_round_cover_fraction` in `Nibble.RoundCoverFraction`); its two degree clauses are
  jointly unsatisfiable on the complete bipartite graph `K_{m,8m}`, because the ceiling is measured
  against the global upper scale `U` and the floor against the global lower scale `L` while a round
  does not halve a spread-out degree distribution uniformly.  `NibbleRoundStep` itself is now ALSO
  refuted — `Nibble.not_nibbleRoundStep` in `Nibble.RoundStepRefutation`, by a two-sided edge count
  on the same witness which no pruning can evade — so this file has no `sorry` left, and no unproved
  obligation either: what it contains is a reduction to a statement that is false.  See the long
  comment where `nibbleRoundStep_holds` used to be, and `Nibble.NibbleRoundStepVar` for the shape a
  repaired round has to have.

* `nibbleRoundStep_of_nibbleRoundProb` — sorry-free (but, by the above, vacuous): the deterministic
  half of the round assuming the refuted probabilistic half.  The
  global ceiling is restored by pruning (`Nibble.pruneHigh`) and the pruning damage is bounded by
  `Nibble.card_pruneDamaged_le_of_bounds`.

* `exists_roundOracle_params_of_nibbleRoundStep` — the reduction (sorry-free): the whole parameter
  selection (`μ`, `η`, `d₀`, `c`, the round budget `T`, the slack `ε` and the exceptional growth
  `δ`), the initialisation of the invariant, its persistence and the geometric decay of the
  uncovered count are all discharged here.  It is what
  `Nibble.roundOracleExistsCeil_of_nibbleRoundStep` consumes.

Everything in this file is sorry-free and axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
The consumers in `Nibble.AdaptiveAssembly` now carry `NibbleRoundStep` as an explicit hypothesis,
since it cannot be discharged.

/-- **The single nibble round (research core).**  For every uniformity `r ≥ 2`, every exceptional
growth budget `δ > 0` and every relative slack `ε ∈ (0, 1/8]` there are a codegree ratio `ecod > 0`
and a degree threshold `L₀` such that: any `r`-uniform `K` avoiding the covered set `S`, with
codegree `≤ ecod·L`, all degrees `≤ U ≤ 8L` and degree `≥ L ≥ L₀` at every uncovered vertex outside
`Exc`, admits a retained set `R' ⊆ K` whose round matching

* covers at least a `1/(256r)` fraction of the good uncovered vertices, and
* leaves a pruned sub-hypergraph `K'` of the residual whose degrees are all `≤ (1/2+ε)U` and which
  still has degree `≥ (1/2-ε)L` at every uncovered vertex outside an exceptional set larger by at
  most `δ|V|`.

This is the standard nibble round: retention probability `p = 1/(2rΔ)` with `Δ = ⌈U⌉` (so
`rΔp = 1/2`, halving all degrees in expectation), a first-moment/Markov selection of one outcome
which simultaneously covers many vertices and has few vertices with an atypical residual degree, and
a deterministic pruning of the few vertices whose residual degree exceeds `(1/2+ε)U` (which is what
re-establishes the global ceiling; the pruning damages the degree of at most `O(rδ|V|/ε)` further
vertices, absorbed into the exceptional set). -/

/-- **The probabilistic round — the sole remaining obligation of the nibble.** -/
theorem nibbleRoundProb_holds : NibbleRoundProb := by
  sorry
```

It is refuted in `Nibble.RoundProbRefutation` by `Nibble.not_nibbleRoundProb`: the complete
bipartite graph `K_{m,8m}` (`r = 2`, hubs of degree `8m = U`, leaves of degree `m = L`, codegree
`≤ 1`, `|V| = 9m`) satisfies every hypothesis of `NibbleRoundProb`, yet for EVERY retained set
`R' ⊆ K` the two degree clauses conflict: a round matching uses up a distinct hub per edge, hence
covers at most `m` leaves, so an uncovered hub keeps residual degree `≥ 7m > 5m = (1/2+ε)U` and is
high; pushing the high set below `blow·|V|` forces all but `9·blow·m` hubs to be covered, and then
the `≥ 7m` uncovered leaves all have residual degree `≤ 9·blow·m < (1/2-ε/2)L`, far more low
vertices than the allowed `δlow·|V|`.

The reason is structural, not a slack issue: the ceiling clause is measured against the GLOBAL upper
scale `U` and the floor clause against the GLOBAL lower scale `L`, while a nibble round only halves
degrees *relative to the local degree distribution*.  As soon as the degrees genuinely spread over
the band `[L, 8L]` that `CeilRoundInv` permits, no retained set halves them uniformly, and the
unpruned residual cannot meet a global ceiling of `(1/2+ε)U`.

What survives:

* the COVER clause of `NibbleRoundProb` is true and is proved unconditionally in
  `Nibble.RoundCoverFraction` (`Nibble.exists_round_cover_fraction`);
* the consumer `NibbleRoundStep` is NOT refuted, because it may prune the residual before the
  ceiling is imposed (`K' ⊆ residual K R'`), and on `K_{m,8m}` a *balanced* pruning of the hubs down
  to `5m` costs each leaf only about `(3/8)m` of its `m` edges, leaving it above `(1/2-ε)L`.  The
  remaining obligation of the nibble is therefore `nibbleRoundStep_holds` itself: a probabilistic
  round together with a pruning that spreads its damage evenly (the greedy pruning of
  `nibbleRoundStep_of_nibbleRoundProb` is not enough, since it is driven by the number of high
  vertices, which the example makes large).

`nibbleRoundStep_of_nibbleRoundProb` below is kept: it is a correct implication, but it is now known
to be vacuous.

```
/-- **The single nibble round — the remaining obligation of the nibble.** -/
theorem nibbleRoundStep_holds : NibbleRoundStep := by
  sorry
```

It is refuted in `Nibble.RoundStepRefutation` by `Nibble.not_nibbleRoundStep`, on the SAME complete
bipartite witness `K_{m,8m}` that refutes `NibbleRoundProb` — but by a two-sided edge count which,
unlike the argument against `NibbleRoundProb`, survives an arbitrary pruning `K' ⊆ residual K R'`.

With `m` hubs of degree `8m = U` and `8m` leaves of degree `m = L`, every edge has one hub and one
leaf, so a round matching of size `k` covers exactly `k` hubs and `k` leaves.  Counting the edges of
`K'` from the hub side (a covered hub has residual degree `0`, every other hub obeys the ceiling)
and from the leaf side (every uncovered leaf outside `Exc'` obeys the floor) gives

  `(8m - k - δ·9m)·(1/2-ε)·m ≤ |K'| ≤ (m - k)·(1/2+ε)·8m`,

hence `7·|support M| ≤ (64ε + 18δ)·m` (`Nibble.BipRef.bip_cover_le_of_step`).  Matching one edge
destroys `4m` units of hub *capacity* but only `m/2` units of leaf *demand*: on a band with
`U/L = 8` the round can therefore cover only an `O(ε + δ)` fraction of the vertices, whereas
`NibbleRoundStep` demands the fixed fraction `1/(256r)` for EVERY `δ, ε > 0`.

What survives, and how to repair it:

* the cover clause alone is true and unconditional (`Nibble.exists_round_cover_fraction`), and so is
  the deterministic pruning machinery (`Nibble.pruneHigh`, `Nibble.card_pruneDamaged_le_of_bounds`);
* the obstruction is *not* probabilistic and not a slack issue: it is the `8 : 1` degree imbalance
  that `CeilRoundInv` permits.  A repaired round must either let its covering fraction degrade with
  `ε` and `δ` (`Nibble.NibbleRoundStepVar` below — but then the round budget `T ≈ log(1/β)/c` no
  longer fits inside the band budget `k ≲ 1/(8ε)` of `hiScale_le_eight_loScale`, so the outer
  schedule of `exists_roundOracle_params_of_nibbleRoundStep` must be redesigned as well), or keep
  the degree band ratio `U/L` near `1` — i.e. genuinely re-establish near-regularity each round,
  which is what the classical nibble does and what makes the obstruction vanish (the loss term
  carries a factor `1 - L/U`).
-/

/-- **A repaired shape for the single nibble round.**  Identical to `NibbleRoundStep` except that
the covering fraction `cfrac` is produced by the round *after* seeing `δ` and `ε`, instead of being
the fixed constant `1/(256r)`.  This is the weakest change that is not refuted by the witness of
`Nibble.not_nibbleRoundStep`, which forces `cfrac ≲ ε + δ/4` on a degree band of ratio `8`.

It is stated here for the record only: it is NOT proved, and — as explained in the comment above —
the outer schedule of `exists_roundOracle_params_of_nibbleRoundStep` (which fixes the covering
fraction before choosing `δ` and `ε`) cannot consume it as it stands. -/
