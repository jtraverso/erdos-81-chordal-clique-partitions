# Yuster Y5 (scaffold) — applying `NibbleTheorem` to the triangle hypergraph

Standalone, Mathlib-only. The Y5 step of the Yuster route: feed the edge-vertex-type triangle
hypergraph `triangleHypergraphSub G` (on `EdgeV G`, whose `Fintype.card` is `|E(G)|`) to
`NibbleTheorem`. Since that hypergraph is `3`-uniform and — under the Y3 hypotheses `NearlyRegular d μ`
and `CodegreeBounded (μ·d)` — meets the nibble's requirements, `NibbleTheorem` yields an edge-disjoint
triangle packing (a matching) of size `≥ (1-β)·|E(G)|/3`.

`NibbleTheorem` and the near-regularity/codegree data are kept as HYPOTHESES: the former is the T3
interface (to be discharged by the nibble machinery), the latter is exactly what
`triangleHypergraph_nearlyRegular_codegreeBounded` (Y3) supplies from a Szemerédi partition. This
scaffold wires the three together, leaving only those two inputs open.

Note the vertex type `EdgeV G` has universe `0` (`{V : Type}`), matching `NibbleTheorem`'s `∀ {V : Type}`.

Must be sorry-free and axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

/-- **Y5 (scaffold) — nibble ⇒ large triangle packing.** Assuming `NibbleTheorem`, there is a
near-regularity tolerance `μ > 0` such that, whenever the edge-type triangle hypergraph is
`(1±μ)`-nearly `d`-regular with codegree `≤ μd`, it has a matching (edge-disjoint triangle packing) of
size `≥ (1-β)·|E(G)|/3`. Direct application of `NibbleTheorem` to `triangleHypergraphSub G`, using
`card_EdgeV` to turn `Fintype.card (EdgeV G)` into `|E(G)| = |cliqueFinset 2|`. -/

/-- **Y5 (majority) — nibble ⇒ large triangle packing, tolerating an exceptional edge set.** The
`NibbleTheoremMost` version of `nibble_gives_triangleSub_matching`: assuming the majority interface,
there are tolerances `μ, η > 0` such that whenever the edge-type triangle hypergraph is
`NearlyRegularMost d μ η` (near-`d`-regular outside an `η`-fraction of edges) with codegree `≤ μd`, it
has an edge-disjoint triangle packing of size `≥ (1-β)·|E(G)|/3`. This is the version the
Szemerédi+counting reconstruction (which yields `NearlyRegularMost`, not strict) feeds. -/
