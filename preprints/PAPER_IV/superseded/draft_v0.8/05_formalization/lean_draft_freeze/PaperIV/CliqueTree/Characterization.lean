# Chordality is equivalent to having a clique tree

`CliqueTree/PEO.lean` builds a clique tree out of a perfect elimination order of a chordal graph.
This file proves the converse implications, turning both constructions into characterisations of
chordality:

* a graph carrying a clique tree is chordal (`SimpleGraph.IsChordal.of_nonempty_cliqueTree`);
* a graph carrying a perfect elimination order is chordal (`SimpleGraph.IsPEO.isChordal`).

The proof of the first statement is direct, with no induction on the graph.  Given a cycle of
length at least `4`, pick the vertex `z` of the cycle whose top node is deepest, i.e. of largest
rank.  The two neighbours of `z` along the cycle share a bag with `z`, so by maximality of the rank
they both lie in the bag of `top z`; that bag is a clique, so they are adjacent, and being at
distance two along a cycle of length at least `4` their edge is not an edge of the cycle.
