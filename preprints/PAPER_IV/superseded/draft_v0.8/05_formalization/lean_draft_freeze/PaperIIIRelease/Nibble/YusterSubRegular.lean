# Yuster (edge-based) — majority near-regularity + codegree bound for `triangleHypergraphSub`

Standalone, Mathlib-only. Assembles the `NibbleTheoremMost` input for the CORRECT (edge-based) triangle
hypergraph `triangleHypergraphSub G`, whose matchings are edge-disjoint triangle packings (`ν₃`).

* The **codegree side is trivial**: `triangleHypergraphSub` has hypergraph-codegree `≤ 1`
  (`triangleHypergraphSub_codegree_le_one`), so `CodegreeBounded C` for any `C ≥ 1` (in particular
  `C = μd ≥ 1`).
* The **degree side** (`NearlyRegularMost`) is packaged from per-edge lower/upper bounds and the
  exceptional (non-regular-degree) edge count `≤ η|E|`, supplied by the edge counting (②a).

* `triangleHypergraphSub_codegreeBounded` — `1 ≤ C → CodegreeBounded (triangleHypergraphSub G) C`.
* `triangleHypergraphSub_nearlyRegularMost_of_bounds` — package `NearlyRegularMost` from per-edge bounds.

Must be sorry-free and axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
