# Dense near-regularity of the triangle hypergraph (proved core of the `hReg` / AX1-② obligation)

`Nibble.AX1.NearRegObligationLinearSized` is stated for ALL graphs, which is too strong (sparse
graphs give the triangle hypergraph too many codegree-0 edges for a fixed exceptional fraction).
The mathematically true and needed content is the DENSE case: for `δ(G) ≥ (9/10)·n` the triangle
hypergraph is genuinely near-`d`-regular with `d = n`, band `μ = 1/5`, and an EMPTY exceptional set
(`η = 0`).  This file discharges exactly that, unconditionally, via
`Nibble.YusterE.triangleSub_linearSized_data_of_minDeg`.

It is the proved ingredient the AX1 reduction needs once it is repaired with a density case-split
(`NibbleGapReduction` currently applies the obligation to an arbitrary `G` — the confirmed gap).
Kept non-destructive: nothing existing is modified.

/-- **Dense near-regularity, concrete window.**  For a graph whose minimum degree `D` satisfies
`9n ≤ 10D` (i.e. `δ(G) ≥ (9/10)n`) and `n ≥ 5`, the triangle hypergraph is nearly `d`-regular with
`d = n`, `μ = 1/5`, EMPTY exceptional set, codegree `≤ μd`, global ceiling `≤ (1+μ)d`, and the linear
size bound `n ≤ 1·d`.  This is exactly the local data of `NearRegObligationLinearSized` with
`μ = 1/5, η = 0, L = 1, d = n`. -/
