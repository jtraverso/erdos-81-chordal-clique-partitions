## Result

The Lean project checks the complete conditional proof perimeter declared by
the following theorem surfaces:

```text
Erdos81.eventualSharpUpperBound_of_inputs :
  Erdos81.ExternalInputs.Inputs -> Erdos81.EventualSharpUpperBound

Erdos81.eventualSharpEquality_of_inputs :
  Erdos81.ExternalInputs.Inputs -> Erdos81.EventualSharpEquality

Erdos81.erdos81_of_inputs :
  Erdos81.ExternalInputs.Inputs -> Erdos81.Erdos81Statement
```

`EventualSharpEquality` states both sides of the extremal result: every large
chordal graph has a partition with at most `sharpBound n` blocks, and for each
large `n` a chordal graph exists whose every clique partition has at least
that many blocks.

## Trust boundary

The proof takes `ExternalInputs.Inputs`, a record with three fields:

- `VizingInput` and `HaggkvistJanssenInput` state the two edge-colouring
  results used by the terminal construction.
- `PackingTransferInput` states the uniform subquadratic integral--fractional
  gap and returns certified rational primal/dual optima plus an attained
  integral optimum for every graph in the relevant finite family.

The packing interface is deliberately stronger than a bare asymptotic
transfer statement: it bundles finite rational LP attainment/strong duality
with the published transfer. Lean proves weak duality and the downstream
comparison, but does not independently derive the supplied primal/dual
optimality witnesses. Accordingly, these are best described as three
external interfaces, not literally as three already-formalized papers.

The following items are outside the checked theorem perimeter:

- proofs of the three external interfaces themselves;
- the manuscript's unused auxiliary bound `L <= n(n-1)` on copy-path length;
- the separate rigidity addendum and its linear-window classification, which
  currently have exact Python certificate replay rather than Lean proofs.

## Verification gate

Run:

```bash
cd lean
lake exe cache get
./check.sh
```

The gate builds the library and audits every public `Erdos81.*` declaration
against an explicit transitive-axiom allowlist. It also rejects common source
forms of `axiom`, `sorry`, and `admit`. The permitted kernel primitives are:

```text
propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound
```

Because the external interfaces are explicit parameters rather than global
axioms, review must inspect the theorem types as well as their axiom output.
